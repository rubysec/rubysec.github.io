  title: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.14, 3.1.x
    before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 does not properly implement
    the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord
    class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL
    injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
    improper handling of nested hashes, a related issue to CVE-2012-2661.
