  title: Command injection in cocoapods-downloader
  date: 2022-04-02
  description: |
    The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command
    Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using
    hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in
    a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform
    a command injection.
  cvss_v3: 8.1
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.6.2"
