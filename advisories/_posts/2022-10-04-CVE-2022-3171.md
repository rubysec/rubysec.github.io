    ## Summary
    A potential Denial of Service issue in `protobuf-java` core and lite was
    discovered in the parsing procedure for binary and text format data.
    Input streams containing multiple instances of non-repeated [embedded
    messages](http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#embedded)
    with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth
    between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage
    collection pauses.

    Reporter: [OSS Fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48771)

    Affected versions: This issue affects both the Java full and lite Protobuf
    runtimes, as well as Protobuf for Kotlin and JRuby, which themselves use the
    Java Protobuf runtime.
