    ### Impact

    The REXML gem before 3.3.6 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an
    XML that has many deep elements that have same local name attributes.

    If you need to parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API like
    `REXML::Document.new`, you may be impacted to this vulnerability.
    If you use other parser APIs such as stream parser API and SAX2
    parser API, this vulnerability is not affected.

    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-43398.
    We strongly recommend upgrading the REXML gem.

    ### Patches

    The REXML gem 3.3.6 or later include the patch to fix the
    vulnerability.

    ### Workarounds

    Don't parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API.

    ## Affected versions

    REXML gem 3.3.5 or prior
