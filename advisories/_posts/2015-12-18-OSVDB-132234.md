  title: rack-attack Gem for Ruby missing normalization before request path processing
  date: 2015-12-18
  description: |
    When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request
    path to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so
    a request path "/login/" becomes "/login" by the time you're in
    ActionController.

    Since Rack::Attack runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not
    yet normalized. This can cause throttles and blacklists to not work as
    expected.

    E.g., a throttle:

    `throttle('logins', ...) {|req| req.path == "/login" }`

    would not match a request to '/login/', though Rails would route
    '/login/' to the same '/login' action.
