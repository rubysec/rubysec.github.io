    by a vulnerability that allows a specially crafted \nJavascript file to have altered
    functionality after minification.\n\nThis bug, found in UglifyJS versions 2.4.23
    and earlier, was demonstrated\nto allow potentially malicious code to be hidden
    within secure code, \nand activated by the minification process.\n\nFor more information,
