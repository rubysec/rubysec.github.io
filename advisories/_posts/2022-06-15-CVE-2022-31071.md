  title: Octopoller gem published with world-writable files
  date: 2022-06-15

    ### Impact

    Version [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0)
    of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically,
    the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e.
    0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644).

    This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the
    instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable
    files from this gem.

    Malicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this
    package, could modify the gemâ€™s files and change its behavior during runtime.

    ### Patches
    * octopoller v0.3.0

    ### Workarounds
    Users can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0).
    Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able
    to upgrade to the latest version.
  cvss_v3: 2.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "!= 0.2.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.3.0"
