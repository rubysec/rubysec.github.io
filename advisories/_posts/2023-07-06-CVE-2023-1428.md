  title: gRPC Reachable Assertion issue
  date: 2023-07-06
  description: |
    There exists an vulnerability causing an abort() to be called in gRPC.
    The following headers cause gRPC's C++ implementation to abort()
    when called via http2:

    te: x (x != trailers)

    :scheme: x (x != http, https)

    grpclb_client_stats: x (x == anything)

    On top of sending one of those headers, a later header must be sent
    that gets the total header size past 8KB. We recommend upgrading
    past git commitÂ 2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8 or v1.53
    and above.
