  title: Local Code Execution through Argument Injection via dash leading git url
    parameter in Gemfile
  date: 2021-12-08
  description: |-
    In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless
    `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless
    that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile`
    includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless,
    values with a leading dash, this can be false.

    To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler
    uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using
    user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions
    before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of
    arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user
    input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead
    of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have
    options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables.

    Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including
    a leading dash.

    ### Exploitation

    To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a
    `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This
    dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to
    construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the
    [upload-pack](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt--ultupload-packgt)
    argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run
    a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside.

    ### Impact

    This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead
    to the takeover of the system. However, as explained above, the exploitability is very
    low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. It still could put developers at
    risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit
    still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by manually
    reviewing the `Gemfile` (although they would need the weird URL with a leading dash to
    not raise any flags).

    This kind of attack vector
    [has been used in the past](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/north-korean-hackers-targeting-security-researchers-on-twitter.html)
    to target security researchers by sending them projects to collaborate on.

    ### Patches

    Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any
    positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue.

    ### Workarounds

    Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrusted
    `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they
    can contain arbitrary ruby code.
