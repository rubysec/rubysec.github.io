    ### Impact

    The patch for the historical vulnerability CVE-2020-35460 in MPXJ
    is incomplete as there is still a possibility that a malicious path
    could be constructed which would not be picked up by the original
    fix and allow files to be written to arbitrary locations.

    ### Patches

    The issue is addressed in MPXJ version 13.5.1

    ### Workarounds

    Do not pass zip files to MPXJ.
