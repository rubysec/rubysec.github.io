  description: |
    While investigating UBSAN errors in https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/5365
    it was discovered Apache Arrow versions 0.12.0 to 0.14.1, left memory Array data
    uninitialized when reading RLE null data from parquet. This affected the C++, Python,
    Ruby and R implementations. The uninitialized memory could potentially be shared
    if are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the
    streaming IPC and file formats.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 0.12.0"
