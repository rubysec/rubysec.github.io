  title: Potential XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails Applications
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x
    before 2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does
    not properly handle mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier
    for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via crafted strings to an
    application that uses a problematic string method, as demonstrated
    by the sub method.
  cvss_v2: 4.3
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.3.12"
  - ">= 3.0.8"
