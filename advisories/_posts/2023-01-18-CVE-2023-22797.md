  title: Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack
  date: 2023-01-18
  description: |-
    There is a vulnerability in Action Controllerâ€™s redirect_to. This
    vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22797.

    Versions Affected: >= 7.0.0
    Not affected: < 7.0.0
    Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1

    # Impact

    There is a possible open redirect when using the redirect_to helper with
    untrusted user input.

    Vulnerable code will look like this:
    ```
    redirect_to(params[:some_param])
    ```

    Rails 7.0 introduced protection against open redirects from calling
    redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was
    fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check
    introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
    the workarounds immediately.

    # Workarounds

    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
