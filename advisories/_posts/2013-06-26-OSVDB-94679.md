  title: enum_column3 Gem for Ruby Symbol Creation Remote DoS
  date: 2013-06-26
  description: |
    The enum_column3 Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that may allow a remote
    denial of service. The issue is due to the program typecasting unexpected strings
    to symbols. This may allow a remote attacker to crash the program.
