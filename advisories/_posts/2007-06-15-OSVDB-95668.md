  title: Builder Gem for Ruby Tag Name Handling Private Method Exposure
  date: 2007-06-15
  description: |
    Builder Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the handling of tag names. The issue
    is triggered when the program reads tag names from XML data and then calls a
    method with that name. With a specially crafted file, a context-dependent
    attacker can call private methods and manipulate data.
