  title: Denial of Service in rubyzip ("zip bombs")
  date: 2019-09-12
  description: |
    In Rubyzip before 1.3.0, a crafted ZIP file can bypass application
    checks on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size
    can be spoofed. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    (disk consumption).
  cvss_v3: 5.5
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.3.0"
