  title: Octokit gem published with world-writable files
  date: 2022-06-15
  description: |
    ### Impact

    Versions [4.23.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.23.0)
    and [4.24.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.24.0) of the octokit gem
    were published containing world-writeable files.

    Specifically, the gem was packed
    with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--`
    (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access
    to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable
    files from this gem.

    Malicious code already present and running on your machine,
    separate from this package, could modify the gemâ€™s files and change its behavior
    during runtime.

    ### Patches

    * [octokit 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)

    ### Workarounds
    Users can use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0).
    Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able
    to upgrade to the latest version.
