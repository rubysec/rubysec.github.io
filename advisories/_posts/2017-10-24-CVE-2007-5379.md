  description: |
    Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby on Rails, allows remote attackers
    and ActiveResource servers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and read
    arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple
    (XML::Simple) unsafely, as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim)
    .purple/accounts.xml file.
