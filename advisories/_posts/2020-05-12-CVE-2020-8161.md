  title: Directory traversal in Rack::Directory app bundled with Rack
  date: 2020-05-12
  description: |
    There was a possible directory traversal vulnerability in the Rack::Directory app
    that is bundled with Rack.

    Versions Affected:  rack < 2.2.0
    Not affected:       Applications that do not use Rack::Directory.
    Fixed Versions:     2.1.3, >= 2.2.0

    Impact
    ------

    If certain directories exist in a director that is managed by
    `Rack::Directory`, an attacker could, using this vulnerability, read the
    contents of files on the server that were outside of the root specified in the
    Rack::Directory initializer.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    Until such time as the patch is applied or their Rack version is upgraded,
    we recommend that developers do not use Rack::Directory in their
    applications.
  cvss_v3: 8.6
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.1.3"
  - ">= 2.2.0"
