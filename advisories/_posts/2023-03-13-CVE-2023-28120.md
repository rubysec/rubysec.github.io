  title: Possible XSS Security Vulnerability in SafeBuffer#bytesplice
  date: 2023-03-13
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability in ActiveSupport if the new bytesplice method is called on a SafeBuffer with untrusted user input.
    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-28120.

    Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.3, 6.1.7.3

    # Impact

    ActiveSupport uses the SafeBuffer string subclass to tag strings as html_safe after they have been sanitized.
    When these strings are mutated, the tag is should be removed to mark them as no longer being html_safe.

    Ruby 3.2 introduced a new bytesplice method which ActiveSupport did not yet understand to be a mutation.
    Users on older versions of Ruby are likely unaffected.

    All users running an affected release and using bytesplice should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

    # Workarounds

    Avoid calling bytesplice on a SafeBuffer (html_safe) string with untrusted user input.
