    Ruby WEBrick read_header HTTP Request Smuggling Vulnerability

    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to smuggle arbitrary HTTP
    requests on affected installations of Ruby WEBrick. This issue is
    exploitable when the product is deployed behind an HTTP proxy that
    fulfills specific conditions.

    The specific flaw exists within the read_headers method. The issue
    results from the inconsistent parsing of terminators of HTTP headers.
    An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to smuggle arbitrary
    HTTP requests. Was ZDI-CAN-21876.
