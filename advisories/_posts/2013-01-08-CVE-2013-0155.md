  title: 'CVE-2013-0155 rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activerecord: Unsafe Query Generation
    Risk in Ruby on Rails'
  date: 2013-01-08
  description: |
    Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before
    3.2.11 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the
    Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers
    to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger
    missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]"
    values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2660 and CVE-2012-2694.
