  title: json Gem for Ruby Data Handling Stack Buffer Overflow
  date: 2007-05-21
  description: |
    json Gem for Ruby contains an overflow condition that is triggered as
    user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling specially crafted
    data. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer
    overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the
    execution of arbitrary code.
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.1.0"
