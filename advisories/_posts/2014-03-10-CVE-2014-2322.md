  title: Arabic Prawn Gem for Ruby lib/string_utf_support.rb User Input Handling Remote
    Command Injection
  date: 2014-03-10
  description: |
    Arabic Prawn Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the lib/string_utf_support.rb
    file. The issue is due to the program failing to sanitize user input. This may
    allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

    "lib/string_utf_support.rb" in the Arabic Prawn 0.0.1 gem for Ruby
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell
    metacharacters  in the (1) downloaded_file or (2) url variable.
  cvss_v2: 7.5
