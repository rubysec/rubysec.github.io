  title: Cross-site scripting vulnerability via `<math>` or `<svg>` element in Sanitize
  description: |
    When HTML is sanitized using Sanitize's "relaxed" config or a custom config that allows certain
    elements, some content in a `<math>` or `<svg>` element may not be sanitized correctly even if
    `math` and `svg` are not in the allowlist.

    You are likely to be vulnerable to this issue if you use Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom
    config that allows one or more of the following HTML elements:

    - `iframe`
    - `math`
    - `noembed`
    - `noframes`
    - `noscript`
    - `plaintext`
    - `script`
    - `style`
    - `svg`
    - `xmp`

    ### Impact

    Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML through Sanitize,
    potentially resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML is
    rendered in a browser.

    ### Releases

    This problem has been fixed in Sanitize 5.2.1.

    ### Workarounds

    If upgrading is not possible, a workaround is to override the default value of Sanitize's
    `:remove_contents` config option with the following value, which ensures that the contents of
    `math` and `svg` elements (among others) are removed entirely when those elements are not in the
    allowlist:

    ```ruby
    %w[iframe math noembed noframes noscript plaintext script style svg xmp]
    ```

    For example, if you currently use Sanitize's relaxed config, you can create a custom config
    object that overrides the default value of `:remove_contents` like this:

    ```ruby
    custom_config = Sanitize::Config.merge(
      Sanitize::Config::RELAXED,
      :remove_contents => %w[iframe math noembed noframes noscript plaintext script style svg xmp]
    )
    ```

    You would then pass this custom config to Sanitize when sanitizing HTML.
