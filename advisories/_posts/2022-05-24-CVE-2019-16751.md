  title: Devise Token Auth vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
  date: 2022-05-24
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Devise Token Auth through 1.1.2. The omniauth
    failure endpoint is vulnerable to Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through the
    message parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can craft a URL that executes a malicious
    JavaScript payload in the victim's browser. This affects the fallback_render method
    in the omniauth callbacks controller.
