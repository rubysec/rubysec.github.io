  title: Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Content-Type Parsing
  date: 2024-02-21
  description: |
    There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the content type
    parsing component of Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
    identifier CVE-2024-25126.

    Versions Affected: >= 0.4 Not affected: < 0.4 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

    # Impact

    Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rack’s media type parser to
    take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service
    vulnerability.

    Impacted code will use Rack’s media type parser to parse content type headers.
    This code will look like below:

    ```
    request.media_type

    ## OR
    request.media_type_params

    ## OR
    Rack::MediaType.type(content_type)
    ```

    Some frameworks (including Rails) call this code internally, so upgrading is
    recommended!

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    # Releases

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    # Workarounds

    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
