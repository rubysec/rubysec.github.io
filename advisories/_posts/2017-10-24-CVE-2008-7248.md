  title: Improper Input Validation in rails
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    Ruby on Rails 2.1 before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.2 does not verify
    tokens for requests with certain content types, which allows remote
    attackers to bypass cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
    for requests to applications that rely on this protection, as
    demonstrated using text/plain.
  cvss_v2: 6.8
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.1.0"

  - "~> 2.1.3"
