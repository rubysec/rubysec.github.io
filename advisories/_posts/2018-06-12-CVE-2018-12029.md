  title: CHMOD race vulnerability
  date: 2018-06-12
  description: |
    The file system access race condition allows for local privilege escalation
    and affects the Nginx module for Passenger versions 5.3.1, all the way back
    to 3.0.0 (the chown command entered the code in 2010).

    The vulnerability was exploitable only when running a non-standard
    `passenger_instance_registry_dir`, via a race condition where after a file
    was created, there was a window in which it could be replaced with a symlink
    before it was chowned via the path and not the file descriptor.

    If the symlink target was to a file which would be executed by root such as
    root's crontab file, then privilege escalation was possible.
  cvss_v2: 4.4
  cvss_v3: 7.0
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 5.3.2"
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 3.0.0"
