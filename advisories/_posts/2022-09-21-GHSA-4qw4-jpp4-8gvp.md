    ### Impact

    CommonMarker uses `cmark-gfm` for rendering [Github Flavored
    Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). A polynomial time complexity issue
    in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion
    and subsequent denial of service.

    ### Patches

    This vulnerability has been patched in the following CommonMarker release:

    - v0.23.6

    ### Workarounds

    Disable use of the autolink extension.
