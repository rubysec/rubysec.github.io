    ### Impact

    Resque Scheduler version 1.27.4 and above are affected by a cross-site
    scripting vulnerability. A remote attacker can inject javascript code
    to the "{schedule_job}" or "args" parameter in
    /resque/delayed/jobs/{schedule_job}?args={args_id} to execute
     javascript at client side.

    ### Patches

    Fixed in v4.10.2

    ### Workarounds

    No known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to not click on
    3rd party or untrusted links to the resque-web interface until you
    have patched your application.
