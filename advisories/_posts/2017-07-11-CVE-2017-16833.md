  title: Stored XSS in "gemirro" via injection in Gemspec "homepage" value
  date: 2017-07-11
  description: |
    Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gemirro allows
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script via a crafted JavaScript URL
    in the "homepage" value of a ".gemspec" file.

    A ".gemspec" file must be created with a JavaScript URL in the homepage
    value. This can be used to build a gem for upload to the Gemirro server,
    in order to achieve stored XSS via the author name hyperlink.
