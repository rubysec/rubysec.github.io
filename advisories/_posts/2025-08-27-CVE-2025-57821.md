  title: Google Sign-In for Rails allowed redirects to malformed URLs

  description: |
    ### Summary

    It is possible to craft a malformed URL that passes the "same origin"
    check, resulting in the user being redirected to another origin.

    ### Details

    The google_sign_in gem persists an optional URL for redirection after
    authentication. If this URL is malformed, it's possible for the user
    to be redirected to another origin after authentication, possibly
    resulting in exposure of authentication information such as the token.

    Normally the value of this URL is only written and read by the library.
    If applications are configured to store session information in a
    database, there is no known vector to exploit this vulnerability.
    However, applications may be configured to store this information
    in a session cookie, in which case it may be chained with a session
    cookie attack to inject a crafted URL.

    ### Impact

    Rails applications configured to store the `flash` information in
    a session cookie may be vulnerable, if this can be chained with an
    attack that allows injection of arbitrary data into the session cookie.

    ### Workarounds

    If you are unable to upgrade this library, then you may mitigate
    the chained attack by explicitly setting `SameSite=Lax` or
    `SameSite=Strict` on the application session cookie.
