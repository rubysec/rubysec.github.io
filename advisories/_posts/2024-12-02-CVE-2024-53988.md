  description: |
    ## Summary

    There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0.

    * Versions affected: 1.6.0
    * Not affected: < 1.6.0
    * Fixed versions: 1.6.1

    ## Impact

    A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
    Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content
    if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer
    has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in the following way:

    - the "math", "mtext", "table", and "style" elements are allowed
    - and either "mglyph" or "malignmark" are allowed

    Code is only impacted if Rails is configured to use HTML5 sanitization,
    please see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
    and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
    for more information on these configuration options.

    The default configuration is to disallow all of these elements
    except for "table". Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being
    overridden. Applications may be doing this in a few different ways:

    1. using application configuration to configure Action View sanitizers'
       allowed tags:

      ```ruby
      # In config/application.rb
      config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "mglyph"]
      # or
      config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "malignmark"]
      ```

      see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view

    2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:

      ```
      <= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "mglyph"] >
      <# or >
      <= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "malignmark"] >
      ```

      see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize

    3. setting Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer class attribute `allowed_tags`:

      ```ruby
      # class-level option
      Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "mglyph"]
      # or
      Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "malignmark"]
      ```

      (note that this class may also be referenced as
      `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

    4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer
       instance method `sanitize`:

      ```ruby
      # instance-level option
      Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "mglyph"])
      # or
      Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "malignmark"])
      ```

      (note that this class may also be referenced as
      `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

    5. setting ActionText::ContentHelper module attribute `allowed_tags`:

      ```ruby
      ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "mglyph"]
      # or
      ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["math", "mtext", "table", "style", "malignmark"]
      ```

    All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms
    to include ("math" and "mtext" and "table" and "style" and ("mglyph"
    or "malignmark")) should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds.

    ## Workarounds

    Any one of the following actions will work around this issue:

    - Remove "mglyph" and "malignmark" from the overridden allowed tags,
    - Or, downgrade sanitization to HTML4 (see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
      and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
      for more information).
