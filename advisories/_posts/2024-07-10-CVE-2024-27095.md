  description: |
    ### Impact

    The admin panel is subject to potential XSS attach in case the attacker
    manages to modify some records being uploaded to the server.

    The attacker is able to change  e.g. to `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`
    if they know how to craft these requests themselves. And then enter
    the returned blob ID to the form inputs manually by modifying the
    edit page source.

    ### Patches

    Available in versions 0.27.6 and 0.28.1.

    ### Workarounds

    Review the user accounts that have access to the admin panel (i.e.
    general Administrators, and participatory space's Administrators)
    and remove access to them if they don't need it.
