  description: |
    There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the Accept header parsing routines
    of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier

    Versions Affected: >= 7.1.0, < 7.1.3.1 Not affected: < 7.1.0 Fixed Versions: 7.1.3.1

    # Impact

    Carefully crafted Accept headers can cause Accept header parsing in

    DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade
    or use one of the workarounds immediately.

    Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using
    Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.
