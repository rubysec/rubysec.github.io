    ### Impact

    CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.

    All applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise`
    are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:
    * Executed whether as:
      * A `before_action` callback (the default)
      * A `prepend_before_action` (option `prepend: true` given) before the
        `:load_object` hook in `Spree::UserController` (most likely order to find).
    * Configured to use ``:null_session` or ``:reset_session` strategies
      (``:null_session` is the default in case the no strategy is given, but `rails --new`
      generated skeleton use ``:exception`).

    That means that applications that haven't been configured differently from
    what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.

    ### Patches

    Spree 4.3 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.4.1
    Spree 4.2 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.2.1
    Spree 4.1 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.1.1
    Older Spree version users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.0.1

    ### Workarounds

    If possible, change your strategy to :exception:

    ```ruby
    class ApplicationController
      < ActionController::Base
      protect_from_forgery with: :exception
    end
    ```

    Add the following to `config/application.rb` to at least run the `:exception`
    strategy on the affected controller:

    ```ruby
    config.after_initialize do
      Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery
      with: :exception
    end
    ```
