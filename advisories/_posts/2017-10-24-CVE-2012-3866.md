  description: |
    lib/puppet/defaults.rb in Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet
    Enterprise before 2.5.2, uses 0644 permissions for last_run_report.yaml,
    which allows local users to obtain sensitive configuration information
    by leveraging access to the puppet master server to read this file.
