  title: Camaleon CMS vulnerable to arbitrary path traversal (GHSL-2024-183)
  date: 2024-09-18
  description: |
    A path traversal vulnerability accessible via MediaController's
    download_private_file method allows authenticated users to download
    any file on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending
    on the file permissions).

    In the [download_private_file] method:

    ```ruby
    def download_private_file
      cama_uploader.enable_private_mode!

      file = cama_uploader.fetch_file("private/#{params[:file]}")

      send_file file, disposition: 'inline'
    end
    ```

    [download_private_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L28

    The file parameter is passed to the [fetch_file] method of the
    CamaleonCmsLocalUploader class (when files are uploaded locally):

    ```ruby
    def fetch_file(file_name)
      raise ActionController::RoutingError, 'File not found' unless file_exists?(file_name)

      file_name
    end
    ```

    [fetch_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb#L27

    If the file exists it's passed back to the download_private_file method
    where the file is sent to the user via [send_file].

    [send_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L33-L34

    ## Proof of concept

    An authenticated user can download the /etc/passwd file by visiting an URL such as:

        https://<camaleon-host>/admin/media/download_private_file?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd

    ## Impact

    This issue may lead to Information Disclosure.

    ## Remediation

    Normalize file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using
    them and check that the resulting path is inside the targeted directory.
    Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as `..` in untrusted
    input that is used to build paths.
