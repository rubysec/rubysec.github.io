  title: Vulnerability in aescrypt because IV is not randomized
  date: 2013-10-01
  description: |
    The aescrypt gem 1.0.0 for Ruby does not randomize the CBC IV for use with the
    AESCrypt.encrypt and AESCrypt.decrypt functions, which allows attackers to
    defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via a chosen plaintext attack.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
