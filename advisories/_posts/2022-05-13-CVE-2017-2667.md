  title: hammer_cli_foreman Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability
  date: 2022-05-13
  description: |
    Hammer CLI, a CLI utility for Foreman, before version 0.10.0, did not
    explicitly set the verify_ssl flag for apipie-bindings that disable it by default.
    As a result the server certificates are not checked and connections are prone to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.
  cvss_v3: 8.1
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.10.0"
