  description: |
    In the yajl-ruby gem 1.3.0 for Ruby, when a crafted JSON file is supplied to
    Yajl::Parser.new.parse, the whole ruby process crashes with a SIGABRT in the
    yajl_string_decode function in yajl_encode.c. This results in the whole ruby
    process terminating and potentially a denial of service.
