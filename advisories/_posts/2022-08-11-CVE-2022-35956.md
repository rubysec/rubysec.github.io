  title: update_by_case before 0.1.3 can be vulnerable to sql injection
  date: 2022-08-11
  description: |
    Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and
    it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version
    >= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with
    sanitized sql.
  cvss_v3: 5.8

  - ">= 0.1.3"
