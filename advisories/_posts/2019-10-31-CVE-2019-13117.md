  title: Nokogiri gem, via libxslt, is affected by multiple vulnerabilities
  date: 2019-10-31
  description: |
    Nokogiri v1.10.5 has been released.

    This is a security release. It addresses three CVEs in upstream libxml2,
    for which details are below.

    If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
    vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
    though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
    (Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that libxslt 1.1.34 addresses
    these vulnerabilities.

    Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue
    [#1943] https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1943.

    CVE-2019-13117

    https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-13117.html

    Priority: Low

    Description: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, an xsl:number with certain format strings
    could lead to a uninitialized read in xsltNumberFormatInsertNumbers. This
    could allow an attacker to discern whether a byte on the stack contains the
    characters A, a, I, i, or 0, or any other character.

    CVE-2019-13118

    https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-13118.html

    Priority: Low

    Description: In numbers.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a type holding grouping characters of an
    xsl:number instruction was too narrow and an invalid character/length
    combination could be passed to xsltNumberFormatDecimal, leading to a read
    of uninitialized stack data

    CVE-2019-18197

    https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-18197.html

    Priority: Medium

    Description: In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable isn't
    reset under certain circumstances. If the relevant memory area happened to
    be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds check could fail and memory
    outside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized data could be
    disclosed.
