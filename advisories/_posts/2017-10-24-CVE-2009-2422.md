  title: High severity vulnerability that affects rails
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    The example code for the digest authentication functionality
    (http_authentication.rb) in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.3 defines
    an authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest block that returns
    nil instead of false when the user does not exist, which allows
    context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication for
    applications that are derived from this example by sending an
    invalid username without a password.
