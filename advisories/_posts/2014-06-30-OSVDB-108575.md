  title: cap-strap Gem for Ruby Hardcoded Password Crypt Hash Salt Weakness
  date: 2014-06-30
  description: |
    cap-strap Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the application
    using a hardcoded default 'sa' salt for password encryption. This may allow a local
    attacker to more easily decrypt passwords.
