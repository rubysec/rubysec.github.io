  title: Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware
  date: 2021-08-19
  description: |
    There is a possible open redirect vulnerability in the Host Authorization
    middleware in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
    identifier CVE-2021-22942.

    Versions Affected: >= 6.0.0.
    Not affected: < 6.0.0
    Fixed Versions: 6.1.4.1, 6.0.4.1

    Impact
    ------

    Specially crafted “X-Forwarded-Host” headers in combination with certain
    “allowed host” formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in
    Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

    Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot.
    For example, configuration files that look like this:

    ```ruby
    config.hosts <<  '.EXAMPLE.com'
    ```

    When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted
    Host header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.

    This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-22881, but CVE-2021-22881 did not
    take in to account domain name case sensitivity.

    Releases
    --------

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    In the case a patch can’t be applied, the following monkey patch can be
    used in an initializer:

    ```ruby
    module ActionDispatch
      class HostAuthorization
        HOSTNAME = /[a-z0-9.-]+|\[[a-f0-9]*:[a-f0-9.:]+\]/i
        VALID_ORIGIN_HOST = /\A(#{HOSTNAME})(?::\d+)?\z/
        VALID_FORWARDED_HOST = /(?:\A|,[ ]?)(#{HOSTNAME})(?::\d+)?\z/

        private
          def authorized?(request)
            origin_host =
              request.get_header("HTTP_HOST")&.slice(VALID_ORIGIN_HOST, 1) || ""
            forwarded_host =
              request.x_forwarded_host&.slice(VALID_FORWARDED_HOST, 1) || ""
            @permissions.allows?(origin_host) &&
              (forwarded_host.blank? || @permissions.allows?(forwarded_host))
          end
      end
    end
    ```
