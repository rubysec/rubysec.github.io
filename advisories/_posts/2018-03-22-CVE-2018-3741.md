  title: XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer
  date: 2018-03-22
  description: |
    There is a possible XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer.  The gem allows
    non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output when input with
    specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack
    on target applications.

    This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah.
