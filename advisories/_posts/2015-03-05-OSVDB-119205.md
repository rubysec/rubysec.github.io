  title: Spree API Information Disclosure CSRF
  date: 2015-03-05
  description: |
    Spree contains a flaw in the API as HTTP requests do not require
    multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
    performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into
    following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker
    can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack
    causing the victim to disclose potentially sensitive information
    to attackers.
