  title: Puma HTTP Request/Response Smuggling vulnerability
  date: 2024-01-08
  description: |2

    ### Impact
    Prior to versions 6.4.2 and 5.6.8, puma exhibited incorrect
    behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies in a
    way that allowed HTTP request smuggling.

    Fixed versions limit the size of chunk extensions. Without this
    limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network
    bandwidth) consumption.

    ### Patches

    The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.4.2 and 5.6.8.

    ### Workarounds

    No known workarounds.
