  title: 'CVE-2013-1800 rubygem-crack: YAML parameter parsing vulnerability'
  date: 2013-01-09
  description: |
    The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
    of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection
    attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
    consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2)
    Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
