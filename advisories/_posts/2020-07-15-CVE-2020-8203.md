  title: Prototype Pollution in lodash
  date: 2020-07-15
  description: |
    Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype
    Pollution. The functions `pick`, `set`, `setWith`, `update`,
    `updateWith`, and `zipObjectDeep` allow a malicious user to
    modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are
    user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires manipulating
    objects based on user-provided property values or arrays.

    This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an
    existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to
    Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.
