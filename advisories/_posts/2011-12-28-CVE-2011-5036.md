  description: |
    Rack before 1.1.3, 1.2.x before 1.2.5, and 1.3.x before 1.3.6 computes
    hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash
    collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.
  cvss_v2: 5.0
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 1.1.3"
  - "~> 1.2.5"
  - "~> 1.3.6"
  - ">= 1.4.0"
