    RubyGems remote_fetcher.rb api_endpoint() Function Missing SRV Record
    Hostname Validation Request Hijacking
  date: 2015-06-08
  description: "RubyGems contains a flaw in the api_endpoint() function in remote_fetcher.rb\nthat
    is triggered when handling hostnames in SRV records. With a specially\ncrafted
    response, a context-dependent attacker may conduct DNS hijacking\nattacks. This
    vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-3900,\nwhich allowed redirection
    to an arbitrary gem server in any security domain. \n"
