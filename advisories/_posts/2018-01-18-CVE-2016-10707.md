  title: Denial of Service in jquery
  date: 2018-01-18
  description: |
    Affected versions of `jquery` use a lowercasing logic on attribute
    names. When given a boolean attribute with a name that contains
    uppercase characters, `jquery` enters into an infinite recursion
    loop, exceeding the call stack limit, and resulting in a denial
    of service condition.

    ## Recommendation

    Update to version 3.0.0 or later.
  cvss_v2: 5.0
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 3.0.0-rc.1"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.0"
