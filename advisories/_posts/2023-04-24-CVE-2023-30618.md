  title: Sensitive Terraform Output Values Printed At Info Logging Level In Kitchen-Terraform

    Summary
      Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all
      Terraform output values, including sensitive values, to be printed
      at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action.
      Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level
      to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default.

    ### Original Report
      @brettcurtis:
        Hopefully, I'm not doing something stupid here, but I'm seeing
        sensitive outputs printed in the kitchen output. You can check
        this action for an example: https://github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-project/actions/runs/4700065515/jobs/8334277309#step:5:215

        It's not really a sensitive value just used it as an example.
