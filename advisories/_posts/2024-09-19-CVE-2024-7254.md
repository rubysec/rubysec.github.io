  title: protobuf-java has potential Denial of Service issue

    ### Summary
    When parsing unknown fields in the Protobuf Java Lite and Full library,
    a maliciously crafted message can cause a StackOverflow error and lead
    to a program crash.

    Reporter: Alexis Challande, Trail of Bits Ecosystem Security
    Team <ecosystem@trailofbits.com>

    Affected versions: This issue affects all versions of both the Java
    full and lite Protobuf runtimes, as well as Protobuf for Kotlin and
    JRuby, which themselves use the Java Protobuf runtime.

    ### Severity
    [CVE-2024-7254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-7254)
    **High** CVSS4.0 Score 8.7 (NOTE: there may be a delay in publication)

    This is a potential Denial of Service. Parsing nested groups as unknown
    fields with DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser,
    or against Protobuf map fields, creates unbounded recursions that can
    be abused by an attacker.

    ### Proof of Concept
    For reproduction details, please refer to the unit tests (Protobuf Java
    [LiteTest](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/a037f28ff81ee45ebe008c64ab632bf5372242ce/java/lite/src/test/java/com/google/protobuf/LiteTest.java)
    and [CodedInputStreamTest](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/a037f28ff81ee45ebe008c64ab632bf5372242ce/java/core/src/test/java/com/google/protobuf/CodedInputStreamTest.java))
    that identify the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.

    ### Remediation and Mitigation
    We have been working diligently to address this issue and have released
    a mitigation that is available now. Please update to the latest
    available versions of the following packages:

    * protobuf-java (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)
    * protobuf-javalite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)
    * protobuf-kotlin (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)
    * protobuf-kotlin-lite (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)
    * com-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.25.5, 4.27.5, 4.28.2)
