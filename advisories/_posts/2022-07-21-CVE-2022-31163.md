    # Impact

    ## Affected versions

    - 0.3.60 and earlier.
    - 1.0.0 to 1.2.9 when used with the Ruby data source (tzinfo-data).

    ## Vulnerability

    With the Ruby data source (the tzinfo-data gem for tzinfo version 1.0.0 and
    later and built-in to earlier versions), time zones are defined in Ruby files.
    There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on
    demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate
    time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the
    identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be
    made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby
    process.

    For example, with version 1.2.9, you can run the following to load a file with
    path `/tmp/payload.rb`:

    ```ruby
    TZInfo::Timezone.get(\"foo\
    /../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/payload\")
    ```

    The exact number of parent directory traversals needed will vary depending on
    the location of the tzinfo-data gem.

    TZInfo versions 1.2.6 to 1.2.9 can be made to load files from outside of the
    Ruby load path. Versions up to and including 1.2.5 can only be made to load
    files from directories within the load path.

    This could be exploited in, for example, a Ruby on Rails application using
    tzinfo version 1.2.9, that allows file uploads and has a time zone selector
    that accepts arbitrary time zone identifiers.
    The CVSS score and severity have been set on this basis.

    Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable.

    # Patches

    Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone
    identifiers.

    Note that version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load
    path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the
    file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path.
    For example if `/tmp/upload` was in the load path, then
    `TZInfo::Timezone.get('foo')` could load a file with path
    `/tmp/upload/tzinfo/definition/foo.rb`. Applications should ensure that
    untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path.

    # Workarounds

    As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to
    `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression
    `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.
