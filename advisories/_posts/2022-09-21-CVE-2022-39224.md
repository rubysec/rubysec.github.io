  title: arr-pm vulnerable to arbitrary shell execution when extracting or listing
    files contained in a malicious rpm
  date: 2022-09-21
  description: |
    ### Impact

    Arbitrary shell execution is possible when using RPM::File#files and
    RPM::File#extract if the RPM contains a malicious "payload compressor" field.

    This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the
    `RPM::File` class in the affected versions of this library.

    ### Patches

    Version 0.0.12 is available with a fix for these issues.

    ### Workarounds

    When using an affected version of this library (arr-pm), ensure any RPMs
    being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values. Such values
    include: gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma.

    You can check the payload compressor field in an rpm by using the rpm command
    line tool. For example:

    ```
    % rpm -qp example-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm --qf "%{PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR}\n"
    gzip
    ```

    ### Impact on known dependent projects

    This library is used by [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm). The
    vulnerability may impact fpm only when using the flag `-s rpm` or
    `--input-type rpm` to convert a malicious rpm to another format. It does
    not impact creating rpms.
