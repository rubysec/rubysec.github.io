  title: CSRF vulnerability in rails_admin
  date: 2016-12-21
  description: |
    The rails_admin gem is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
    Due to a bug, non-GET methods were not validating CSRF tokens and, as a result,
    an attacker could hypothetically gain access to the application administrative
    endpoints exposed by the gem.
