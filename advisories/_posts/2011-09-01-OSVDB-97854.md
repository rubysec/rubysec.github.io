  title: Dragonfly Gem for Ruby on Windows Shell Escaping Weakness
  date: 2011-09-01
  description: |
    Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program
    failing to properly escape a shell that contains injected characters.
    This may allow a context-dependent attacker to potentially execute
    arbitrary commands.

    This gem has been renamed. Please use "dragonfly" from now on.
