  title: Nokogiri patches vendored libxml2 to resolve multiple CVEs
  date: 2025-07-21
  description: |
    ## Summary

    Nokogiri v1.18.9 patches the vendored libxml2 to address
    CVE-2025-6021, CVE-2025-6170, CVE-2025-49794, CVE-2025-49795,
    and CVE-2025-49796.

    ## Impact and severity

    ### CVE-2025-6021

    A flaw was found in libxml2's xmlBuildQName function, where integer
    overflows in buffer size calculations can lead to a stack-based
    buffer overflow. This issue can result in memory corruption or a
    denial of service when processing crafted input.

    NVD claims a severity of 7.5 High
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

    Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/17d950ae

    ### CVE-2025-6170

    A flaw was found in the interactive shell of the xmllint command-line
    tool, used for parsing XML files. When a user inputs an overly long
    command, the program does not check the input size properly, which
    can cause it to crash. This issue might allow attackers to run
    harmful code in rare configurations without modern protections.

    NVD claims a severity of 2.5 Low
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

    Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/5e9ec5c1

    ### CVE-2025-49794

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in libxml2. This issue
    occurs when parsing XPath elements under certain circumstances when
    the XML schematron has the <sch:name path="..."/> schema elements.
    This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft a malicious XML document
    used as input for libxml, resulting in the program's crash using
    libxml or other possible undefined behaviors.

    NVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

    Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/81cef8c5

    ### CVE-2025-49795

    A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libxml2 when
    processing XPath XML expressions. This flaw allows an attacker to
    craft a malicious XML input to libxml2, leading to a denial of service.

    NVD claims a severity of 7.5 High
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

    Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/62048278

    ### CVE-2025-49796

    A vulnerability was found in libxml2. Processing certain sch:name
    elements from the input XML file can trigger a memory corruption
    issue. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input
    file that can lead libxml to crash, resulting in a denial of service
    or other possible undefined behavior due to sensitive data being
    corrupted in memory.

    NVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

    Fixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/81cef8c5

    ## Affected Versions

    - Nokogiri < 1.18.9 when using CRuby (MRI) with vendored libxml2

    ## Patched Versions

    - Nokogiri >= 1.18.9

    ## Mitigation

    Upgrade to Nokogiri v1.18.9 or later.

    Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more
    complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against patched
    external libxml2 libraries which will also address these same issues.
