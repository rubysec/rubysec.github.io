    ## Impact

    Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a
    bug in a webserver (https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack
    middleware. In the event a response is not notified of a `close`,
    `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the
    next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests,
    especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

    Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation if this issue
    even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

    ## Patches

    This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

    ## Workarounds

    Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following
    middleware can be used:

    ```
    class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
      def call(env)
        ensure_completed!
        super
      end

      private

        def ensure_completed!
          @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
        end
    end

    # Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
    Rails.application.configure do
      config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
    end
    ```
