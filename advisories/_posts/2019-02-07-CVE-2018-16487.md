  title: Prototype Pollution in lodash
  date: 2019-02-07
  description: |
    Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.11 are vulnerable to
    prototype pollution.

    The vulnerable functions are 'defaultsDeep', 'merge', and
    'mergeWith' which allow a malicious user to modify the
    prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype:
    {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing
    property that will exist on all objects.

    ## Recommendation

    Update to version 4.17.11 or later.
  cvss_v2: 6.8
  cvss_v3: 5.6
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.17.11"
