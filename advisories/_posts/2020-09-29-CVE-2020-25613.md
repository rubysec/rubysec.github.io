  title: Potential HTTP Request Smuggling Vulnerability in WEBrick
  date: 2020-09-29
  description: |
    WEBrick was too tolerant against an invalid Transfer-Encoding header. This may lead to
    inconsistent interpretation between WEBrick and some HTTP proxy servers, which may
    allow the attacker to "smuggle" a request. See CWE-444 in detail.
