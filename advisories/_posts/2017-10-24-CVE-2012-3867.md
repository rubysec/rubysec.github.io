  description: |
    lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and
    2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not
    properly restrict the characters in the Common Name field of a
    Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which makes it easier for
    user-assisted remote attackers to trick administrators into
    signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI control sequences.
  cvss_v2: 4.3
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.6.17"
  - ">= 2.7.18"
