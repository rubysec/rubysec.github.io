  title: HTML injection/XSS in Sanitize
  date: 2018-03-19
  description: |
    When Sanitize gem is used in combination with libxml2 >= 2.9.2,
    a specially crafted HTML fragment can cause libxml2 to generate
    improperly escaped output, allowing non-whitelisted attributes to be
    used on whitelisted elements.

    This can allow HTML and JavaScript injection, which could result in XSS
    if Sanitize's output is served to browsers.
