  title: Possible Log Injection in Rack::CommonLogger
  date: 2025-02-12
  description: |
    ## Summary

    `Rack::CommonLogger` can be exploited by crafting input that includes
    newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied
    proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs.

    ## Details

    When a user provides the authorization credentials via
    `Rack::Auth::Basic`, if success, the username will be put in
    `env['REMOTE_USER']` and later be used by `Rack::CommonLogger`
    for logging purposes.

    The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally
    allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white
    space characters, or the server just want to log every login
    attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character,
    the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters
    into the logfile.

    ## Impact

    Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries,
    potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data
    into log files.

    ## Mitigation

    - Update to the latest version of Rack.
