  title: ruby-saml gem is vulnerable to XPath injection
  date: 2015-04-29
  description: |
    xml_security.rb in the ruby-saml gem before 1.0.0 for Ruby
    allows XPath injection and code execution because prepared
    statements are not used.

    The lack of prepared statements allows for possibly command
    injection, leading to arbitrary code execution.
