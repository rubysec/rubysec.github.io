  title: Command injection in ruby-git
  date: 2022-04-20
  description: |
    The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via
    git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function,
    the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional
    flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.
