  title: Pageflow vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in membership update
    endpoint

    ### Impact

    Pageflow has a membership edit feature which allows users to edit the roles of user
    memberships associated with an account that they have the `manager` role to (including
    their own). While the `Entity` dropdown select field is greyed out in the UI, an attacker
    can use tools which allow sending arbitrary HTTP request to craft a request to the
    `/admin/users/{user_id}/memberships/{membership_id}` endpoint containing an additional
    `membership[entity_id]` parameter. This parameter is honored when the membership is
    updated, allowing an attacker to update the membership object associated with their own
    account (with `manager` role) to be associated with a different attacker-chosen account
    instead. Since `account_id`s are enumerable, an attacker can compromise all accounts
    present on the platform.

    ### Mitigation

    Upgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 14.5.2"
  - ">= 15.7.1"
