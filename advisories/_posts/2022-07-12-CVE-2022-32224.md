  title: Possible RCE escalation bug with Serialized Columns in Active Record
  date: 2022-07-12
  description: |
    There is a possible escalation to RCE when using YAML serialized columns in
    Active Record. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2022-32224.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       None
    Fixed Versions:     7.0.3.1, 6.1.6.1, 6.0.5.1, 5.2.8.1

    Impact
    ------
    When serialized columns that use YAML (the default) are deserialized, Rails
    uses `YAML.unsafe_load` to convert the YAML data in to Ruby objects.  If an
    attacker can manipulate data in the database (via means like SQL injection),
    then it may be possible for the attacker to escalate to an RCE.

    Impacted Active Record models will look something like this:

    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      serialize :options       # Vulnerable: Uses YAML for serialization
      serialize :values, Array # Vulnerable: Uses YAML for serialization
      serialize :values, JSON  # Not vulnerable
    end
    ```

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

    The released versions change the default YAML deserializer to use
    `YAML.safe_load`, which prevents deserialization of possibly dangerous
    objects.  This may introduce backwards compatibility issues with existing
    data.

    In order to cope with that situation, the released version also contains two
    new Active Record configuration options.  The configuration options are as
    follows:

    * `config.active_record.use_yaml_unsafe_load`

    When set to true, this configuration option tells Rails to use the old
    "unsafe" YAML loading strategy, maintaining the existing behavior but leaving
    the possible escalation vulnerability in place.  Setting this option to true
    is *not* recommended, but can aid in upgrading.

    * `config.active_record.yaml_column_permitted_classes`

    The "safe YAML" loading method does not allow all classes to be deserialized
    by default.  This option allows you to specify classes deemed "safe" in your
    application.  For example, if your application uses Symbol and Time in
    serialized data, you can add Symbol and Time to the allowed list as follows:

    ```
    config.active_record.yaml_column_permitted_classes = [Symbol, Date, Time]
    ```

    Workarounds
    -----------
    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue, but other coders (such as
    JSON) are not impacted.
