    ## Summary

    Nokogiri v1.18.8 upgrades its dependency libxml2 to
    [v2.13.8](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.13.8).

    libxml2 v2.13.8 addresses:

    - CVE-2025-32414
      - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/889
    - CVE-2025-32415
      - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/890

    ## Impact

    ### CVE-2025-32414: No impact

    In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2, out-of-bounds
    memory access can occur in the Python API (Python bindings) because
    of an incorrect return value. This occurs in xmlPythonFileRead and
    xmlPythonFileReadRaw because of a difference between bytes and characters.

    **There is no impact** from this CVE for Nokogiri users.

    ### CVE-2025-32415: Low impact

    In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2,
    xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables in xmlschemas.c has a heap-based buffer
    under-read. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated
    against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a
    crafted XML schema must be used.

    In the upstream issue, further context is provided by the maintainer:

    > The bug affects validation against untrusted XML Schemas (.xsd)
    > and validation of untrusted documents against trusted Schemas if
    > they make use of xsd:keyref in combination with recursively
    > defined types that have additional identity constraints.

    MITRE has published a severity score of 2.9 LOW
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) for this CVE.
