  title: brbackup Gem for Ruby dbuser Variable Shell Metacharacter Injection Remote
    Command Execution
  date: 2014-07-09
  description: |
    brbackup Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered as input passed
    via the 'dbuser' variable is not properly sanitized. This may allow a
    remote attacker to inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary
    commands.
  notes: Never patched
