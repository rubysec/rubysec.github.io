  description: |
    This affects the package clearance before 2.5.0. The vulnerability can
    be possible when users are able to set the value of session[:return_to]. If the
    value used for return_to contains multiple leading slashes (/////example.com) the
    user ends up being redirected to the external domain that comes after the slashes
    (http://example.com).
  cvss_v3: 7.6
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.5.0"
