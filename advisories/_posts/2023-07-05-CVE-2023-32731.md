  title: Connection confusion in gRPC
  date: 2023-07-05
  description: |
    When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it
    skipped parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK
    table mutations to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization
    of HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say,
    between a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the
    proxy being interpreted as containing headers from different
    proxy clients
    - leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege
      escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond
      the commit contained inÂ  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309
