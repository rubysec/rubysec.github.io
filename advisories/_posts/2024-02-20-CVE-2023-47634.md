  title: Race condition in Endorsements

  description: |
    ### Impact

    A race condition in the endorsement of resources (for instance,
    a proposal) allows a user to make more than once endorsement.

    To exploit this vulnerability, the request to set an
    endorsement must be sent several times in parallel.

    ### Workarounds

    Disable the Endorsement feature in the components.
