  title: gRPC connection termination issue
  date: 2023-07-06
  description: |
    gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a
    termination of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server:
    a base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in
    a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is typically allowed by
    HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit in
    https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309.
