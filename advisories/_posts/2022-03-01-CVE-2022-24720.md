  title: Remote shell execution vulnerability when applying commands from user input
  date: 2022-03-01
  description: |-
    ### Impact

    When using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input, this allows the attacker to execute shell commands:

    ```rb
    ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo EXECUTED" })
    #>> EXECUTED
    ```

    This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well.

    ### Patches

    The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing.

    ### Workarounds

    If you're processing based on user input, it's highly recommended that you always sanitize the user input, by allowing only a constrained set of operations. For example:

    ```rb
    operations = params[:operations]
      .map { |operation| [operation[:name], *operation[:value]] }
      .select { |name, *| name.to_s.include? %w[resize_to_limit strip ...] } # sanitization

    ImageProcessing::Vips.apply(operations)
    ```
