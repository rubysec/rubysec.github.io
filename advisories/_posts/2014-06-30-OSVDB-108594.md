  title: gnms Gem for Ruby /lib/cmd_parse.rb ip Variable Shell Metacharacter Handling
    Remote Command Injection
  date: 2014-06-30
  description: |
    gnms Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/cmd_parse.rb that is triggered
    when handling shell metacharacters passed via the 'ip' variable.
    This may allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
  notes: Never patched
