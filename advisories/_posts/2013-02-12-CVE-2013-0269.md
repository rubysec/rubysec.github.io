  description: |
    The JSON gem before 1.5.5, 1.6.x before 1.6.8, and 1.7.x before 1.7.7
    for Ruby allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption)
    or bypass the mass assignment protection mechanism via a crafted JSON document that
    triggers the creation of arbitrary Ruby symbols or certain internal objects, as
    demonstrated by conducting a SQL injection attack against Ruby on Rails, aka "Unsafe
    Object Creation Vulnerability."
  cvss_v2: 9.0
