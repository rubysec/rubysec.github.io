  title: Arbitrary file write/potential remote code execution in actionpack-page_caching
  date: 2020-05-06
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability in the actionpack-page_caching gem that allows an attacker
    to write arbitrary files to a web server, potentially resulting in remote code execution
    if the attacker can write unescaped ERB to a view.

    Versions Affected:  All versions of actionpack-page_caching (part of Rails prior to Rails 4.0)
    Not affected:       Applications not using actionpack-page_caching
    Fixed Versions:     actionpack-page_caching >= 1.2.1

    Impact
    ------

    The Action Pack Page Caching gem writes cache files to the file system in
    order for the front end webserver (nginx, Apache, etc) to serve the cached
    file without making a request to the application server.  Paths contain what
    is effectively user input can be used to manipulate the location of the cache
    file.

    For example "/users/123" could be changed to "/users/../../../foo" and this
    will escape the cache directory.  Attackers can use this technique to
    springboard to an RCE if they can write arbitrary ERb to a view folder.

    Impacted code looks like this:

    ```
    class BooksController < ApplicationController
      caches_page :show
    end
    ```

    Where the `show` action of the `BooksController` may be vulnerable.
