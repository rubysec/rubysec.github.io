    Possible Denial of Service attack in Active Support
  date: 2015-06-16
  description: "Specially crafted XML documents can cause applications to raise a
    \n`SystemStackError` and potentially cause a denial of service attack.  This \nonly
    impacts applications using REXML or JDOM as their XML processor.  Other \nXML
    processors that Rails supports are not impacted. \n\nAll users running an affected
    release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.\n\nWorkarounds
    \n----------- \nUse an XML parser that is not impacted by this problem, such as
    Nokogiri or \nLibXML.  You can change the processor like this: \n\n  ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend
    = 'Nokogiri' \n\nIf you cannot change XML parsers, then adjust \n`RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE`.
