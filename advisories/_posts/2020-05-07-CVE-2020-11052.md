  title: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in Sorcery
  description: |
    ### Impact
    Brute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery.
    The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for
    the defined lockout period, but once expired protection will not be re-enabled
    until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users
    that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use
    permanent account lockout.

    ### Patches
    Patched as of version `0.15.0`.

    ### Workarounds
    Currently no workarounds, other than monkey patching the authenticate method
    provided by Sorcery or upgrading to version `0.15.0`.
  cvss_v3: 8.3
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.15.0"
