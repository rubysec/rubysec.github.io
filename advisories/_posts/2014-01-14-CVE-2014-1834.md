  title: echor Gem for Ruby backplane.rb perform_request Function Arbitrary Command
    Execution
  date: 2014-01-14
  description: |
    Echor Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in backplane.rb in the perform_request
    function that is triggered when a semi-colon (;) is injected into a username
    or password. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to inject arbitrary
    commands if the gem is used in a rails application.
