    ### Impact

    Users settings their active admin form legends dynamically may be
    vulnerable to stored XSS, as long as its value can be injected
    directly by a malicious user.

    For example:

    * A public web application allows users to create entities with
      arbitrary names.
    * Active Admin is used to administrate these entities through a
      private backend.
    * The form to edit these entities in the private backend has the
      following shape (note the dynamic `name` value dependent on an
      attribute of the `resource`):

    ```ruby
      form do |f|
        f.inputs name: resource.name do
          f.input :name
          f.input :description
        end

        f.actions
      end
    ```

    Then a malicious user could create an entity with a payload that
    would get executed in the active admin administrator's browser.

    Both `form` blocks with an implicit or explicit name (i.e., both
    `form resource.name` or `form name: resource.name` would suffer
    from the problem), where the value of the name can be arbitrarily
    set by non admin users.

    ### Patches

    The problem has been fixed in ActiveAdmin 3.2.2 and ActiveAdmin 4.0.0.beta7.

    ### Workarounds

    Users can workaround this problem without upgrading by explicitly
    escaping the form name using an HTML escaping utility. For example:

    ```ruby
      form do |f|
        f.inputs name: ERB::Util.html_escape(resource.name) do
          f.input :name
          f.input :description
        end

        f.actions
      end
    ```
    Upgrading is of course recommended though.
