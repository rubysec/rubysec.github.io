  title: Elastic APM agent for Ruby vulnerable to Improper Certificate Validation
  date: 2022-05-24
  description: |
    A TLS certificate validation flaw was found in Elastic APM agent for
    Ruby versions before 2.9.0. When specifying a trusted server CA certificate via
    the `server_ca_cert` setting, the Ruby agent would not properly verify the certificate
    returned by the APM server. This could result in a man in the middle style attack
    against the Ruby agent.
