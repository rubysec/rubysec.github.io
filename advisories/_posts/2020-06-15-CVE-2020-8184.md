  title: Percent-encoded cookies can be used to overwrite existing prefixed cookie
    names
  date: 2020-06-15
  description: |
    It is possible to forge a secure or host-only cookie prefix in Rack using
    an arbitrary cookie write by using URL encoding (percent-encoding) on the
    name of the cookie. This could result in an application that is dependent on
    this prefix to determine if a cookie is safe to process being manipulated
    into processing an insecure or cross-origin request.
    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2020-8184.

    Versions Affected:  rack < 2.2.3, rack < 2.1.4
    Not affected:       Applications which do not rely on __Host- and __Secure- prefixes to determine if a cookie is safe to process
    Fixed Versions:     rack >= 2.2.3, rack >= 2.1.4

    Impact
    ------

    An attacker may be able to trick a vulnerable application into processing an
    insecure (non-SSL) or cross-origin request if they can gain the ability to write
    arbitrary cookies that are sent to the application.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    If your application is impacted but you cannot upgrade to the released versions or apply
    the provided patch, this issue can be temporarily addressed by adding the following workaround:

    ```
    module Rack
      module Utils
        module_function def parse_cookies_header(header)
          return {} unless header
          header.split(/[;] */n).each_with_object({}) do |cookie, cookies|
            next if cookie.empty?
            key, value = cookie.split('=', 2)
            cookies[key] = (unescape(value) rescue value) unless cookies.key?(key)
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
