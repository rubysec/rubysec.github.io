  title: bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby incorrect encoding of non US-ASCII characters (JRuby
    only)
  date: 2010-02-01
  description: |
    In https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BCRYPT-20009, found
    "The advisory has been revoked - it doesn't affect any version of package bcrypt"

    bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby suffered from a bug related to character
    encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords
    containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step
    transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing.
    In the worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII
    characters, this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other
    such passwords of the same length.

    This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.
