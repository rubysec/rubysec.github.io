  title: Prototype Pollution in lodash
  date: 2019-07-10
  description: |
    Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype
    Pollution.  The function `defaultsDeep` allows a malicious user
    to modify the prototype of `Object` via
    `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or
    modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.

    ## Recommendation

    Update to version 4.17.12 or later.
  cvss_v2: 6.4
  cvss_v3: 9.1
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.17.12"
