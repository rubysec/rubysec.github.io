  title: Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in i18n translations helper method
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the 'translate' helper
    method of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML escaping of interpolated user
    input, when interpolation in combination with HTML-safe translations were
    used. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web
    script by providing a specially-crafted input to Ruby on Rails application,
    using the ActionPack module and its 'translate' helper method without explicit
    (application specific) sanitization of user provided input.

    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the i18n translations helper
    method in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.11 and 3.1.x before 3.1.2,
    and the rails_xss plugin in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related
    to a translations string whose name ends with an "html" substring.
