    ### Summary

    The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating
    a record with user input, and does not validate them in the back end.
    This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution, or
    application crashes when viewing a manipulated record.

    ### Details

    After reviewing the polymorphic field implementation and performing
    some black box approaches, we identified a potential security issue
    related to the use of safe_constantize / constantize. This Rails
    functionality is capable of searching for classes within the Rails
    context and returning the class for further use. Because Avo does
    not validate user input when updating or creating a new polymorphic
    resource, it is possible to create database entries with completely
    different or invalid class names than the preselected ones. Avo
    assumes that the class specified by the user request is a valid one
    and attempts to work with it, which may result in dangerous behavior
    and code execution.

    ### Impact

    The final exploitation of this vulnerability requires more time than
    is provided in this assessment, but initial testing of the post request
    shows the potential critical risk. The classes could be instantiated
    at any point in the code and this could also lead to code execution.

    ### Recommendation

    Avo should be configured to never trust user-supplied input, especially
    when defining classes for records. In this particular case, Avo can
    evaluate the options list given for the polymorphic field and only allow
    strings from that list. With this white-list approach, an attacker
    cannot supply unintended classes.
