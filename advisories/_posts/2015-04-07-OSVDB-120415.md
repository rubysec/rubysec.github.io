  title: redcarpet Gem for Ruby markdown.c parse_inline() Function XSS
  date: 2015-04-07
  description: |
    redcarpet Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the parse_inline() function in
    markdown.c does not validate input before returning it to users. This may
    allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would
    execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust
    relationship between their browser and the server.
