  title: Denial of Service Vulnerability in gRPC TCP Server (Posix-compatible platforms)
  date: 2023-09-13
  description: |
    Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting
    version 1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an
    attacker to cause a denial of service by initiating a significant
    number of connections with the server.

    Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but
    gRPC Java and Go are NOT affected.Â
