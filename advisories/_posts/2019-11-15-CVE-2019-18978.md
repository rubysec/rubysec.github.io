  title: rack-cors directory traversal via path
  date: 2019-11-15
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in the rack-cors (aka Rack CORS Middleware) gem
    before 1.0.4 for Ruby. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private resources
    because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format.
  cvss_v3: 5.3
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.0.4"
