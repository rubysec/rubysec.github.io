  title: Regression in JWT Signature Validation
  description: |
    ### Overview
    Versions after and including `2.3.0` are improperly validating the JWT token signature when
    using the `JWTValidator.verify` method.  Improper validation of the JWT token signature when
    not using the default Authorization Code Flow can allow an attacker to bypass authentication
    and authorization.

    ### Am I affected?
    You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

    - You are using `omniauth-auth0`.
    - You are using `JWTValidator.verify` method directly OR you are not authenticating using the
      SDKâ€™s default Authorization Code Flow.

    ### How to fix that?
    Upgrade to version `2.4.1`.

    ### Will this update impact my users?
    The fix provided in this version will not affect your users.
