  title: Devise-Two-Factor vulnerable to brute force attacks
  date: 2024-01-12
  description: |
    Devise-Two-Factor does not throttle or otherwise restrict login
    attempts at the server by default. When combined with the Time-based
    One Time Password algorithm's (TOTP) inherent entropy limitations,
    it's possible for an attacker to bypass the 2FA mechanism through
    brute-force attacks.

    ### Impact

    If a user's username and password have already been compromised an
    attacker would be able to try possible TOTP codes and see if they
    can hit a lucky collision to log in as that user. The user under
    attack would not necessarily know that their account has been
    compromised.

    ### Patches

    Devise-Two-Factor has not released any fixes for this vulnerability.
    This library is open-ended by design and cannot solve this for all
    applications natively. It's recommended that any application leveraging
    Devise-Two-Factor implement controls at the application level to
    mitigate this threat. A non-exhaustive list of possible mitigations
    can be found below.

    #### Mitigations

    1. Use the `lockable` strategy from Devise to lock a user after a
       certain number of failed login attempts. See
       https://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Lockable
       for more information.

    2. Configure a rate limit for your application, especially on the
       endpoints used to log in. One such library to accomplish this is
       [rack-attack](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-attack).

    3. When displaying authentication errors hide whether validating a
       username/password combination failed or a two-factor code failed
       behind a more generic error message.
