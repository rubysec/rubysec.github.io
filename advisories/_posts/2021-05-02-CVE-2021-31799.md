  title: RDoc OS command injection vulnerability
  date: 2021-05-02
  description: |
    RDoc used to call `Kernel#open` to open a local file. If a Ruby project has
    a file whose name starts with `|` and ends with `tags`, the command following
    the pipe character is executed. A malicious Ruby project could exploit it to
    run an arbitrary command execution against a user who attempts to run `rdoc`
    command.
