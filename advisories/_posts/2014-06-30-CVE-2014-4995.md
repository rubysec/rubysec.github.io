  date: 2014-06-30
  description: |
    VladTheEnterprising Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates
    temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use
    a symlink attack against the /tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host} file they can
    overwrite arbitrary files, gain access to the MySQL root password,
    or inject arbitrary commands.
