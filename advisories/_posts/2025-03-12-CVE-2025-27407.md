  title: graphql allows remote code execution when loading a crafted GraphQL schema
  date: 2025-03-12
  description: |
    Loading a malicious schema definition in
    `GraphQL::Schema.from_introspection` (or `GraphQL::Schema::Loader.load`)
    can result in remote code execution. Any system which loads a schema
    by JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable, including those that
    use [GraphQL::Client](https://github.com/github-community-projects/graphql-client)
    to load external schemas via GraphQL introspection.
