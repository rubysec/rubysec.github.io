  title: Possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability
  description: |
    There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack.

    Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks
    targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a
    database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that
    session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up
    a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack
    the session.

    The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is
    indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.

    Impact:

    The session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when querying
    the backing session storage engine.  Most storage mechanisms (for example a
    database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up the lookup of that
    id.  By carefully timing requests and session lookup failures, an attacker
    may be able to perform a timing attack to determine an existing session id
    and hijack that session.
