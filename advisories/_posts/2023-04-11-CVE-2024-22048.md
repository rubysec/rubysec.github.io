    ### Impact

    Pages that are indexed in search results have their entire contents
    indexed, including any HTML code snippets. These HTML snippets would
    appear in the search results unsanitised, so it was possible to
    render arbitrary HTML or run arbitrary scripts.

    This is a low risk security issue; to exploit it, an attacker would
    need to find a way of committing malicious code to a page indexed
    by a site that uses tech-docs-gem (which are typically not editable
    by untrusted users). Their code would also be limited by the relatively
    short length that's rendered in the corresponding search result.
    Nevertheless, the XSS would then be triggerable by visiting a
    pre-constructed URL (/search/index.html?q=some+search+term), which
    users could be tricked into clicking on through social engineering.

    ### Patches

    This has been fixed in v3.3.1. HTML is now sanitised in search results.
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.0.2"

  - ">= 3.3.1"
