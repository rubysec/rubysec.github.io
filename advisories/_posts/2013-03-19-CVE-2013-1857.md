  description: |
    'The sanitize helper in lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb
    in the Action Pack component in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.18, 3.0.x and 3.1.x before
    3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters
    in URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks via a crafted scheme name, as demonstrated by including a &#x3a; sequence.
    A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Action Pack. A remote attacker could
    use this flaw to conduct XSS attacks against users of an application using Action
    Pack.'
