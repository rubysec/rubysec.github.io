  title: 'CVE-2007-0469 RubyGems: Specially-crafted Gem archive can overwrite system
    files'
  date: 2007-01-22
  description: |
    The extract_files function in installer.rb in RubyGems before 0.9.1 does
    not check whether files exist before overwriting them, which allows user-assisted
    remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or execute
    arbitrary code via crafted GEM packages.
  cvss_v2: 9.3
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.9.1"
