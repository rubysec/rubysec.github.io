  title: Pageflow vulnerable to sensitive user data extraction via Ransack query injection
  date: 2022-09-15
  description: |
    ### Impact

    The attack allows extracting sensitive properties of database objects that are
    associated with users or entries belonging to an account that the attacker has access
    to.

    Pageflow uses the `ActiveAdmin` Ruby library to provide some management features to
    its users. `ActiveAdmin` relies on the `Ransack` library to implement search
    functionality. In its default configuration, `Ransack` will allow for query conditions
    based on properties of associated database objects [1]. The `*_starts_with`,
    `*_ends_with` or `*_contains` search matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate
    sensitive string values of associated database objects via character-by-character
    brute-force.

    ### Mitigation

    Upgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 14.5.2"
  - ">= 15.7.1"
