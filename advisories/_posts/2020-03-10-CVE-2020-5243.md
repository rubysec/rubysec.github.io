  title: Denial of Service in uap-core when processing crafted User-Agent strings
  description: |
    ### Impact
    Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to
    overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by
    setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long
    strings.

    ### Patches
    Please update `uap-ruby` to &gt;= v2.6.0
