  date: 2025-03-14
  description: |
    A Privilege Escalation through a Mass Assignment exists in Camaleon CMS

    When a user wishes to change his password, the 'updated_ajax' method
    of the UsersController is called. The vulnerability stems from the
    use of the dangerous permit!Â method, which allows all parameters to
    pass through without any filtering.
