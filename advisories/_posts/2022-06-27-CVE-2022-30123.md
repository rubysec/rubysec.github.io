  title: Possible shell escape sequence injection vulnerability in Rack
  date: 2022-06-27
  description: |
    There is a possible shell escape sequence injection vulnerability in the Lint
    and CommonLogger components of Rack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the
    CVE identifier CVE-2022-30123.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       None
    Fixed Versions:     2.0.9.1, 2.1.4.1, 2.2.3.1

    ## Impact
    Carefully crafted requests can cause shell escape sequences to be written to
    the terminal via Rack's Lint middleware and CommonLogger middleware.  These
    escape sequences can be leveraged to possibly execute commands in the victim's
    terminal.

    Impacted applications will have either of these middleware installed, and
    vulnerable apps may have something like this:

    ```
    use Rack::Lint
    ```

    Or

    ```
    use Rack::CommonLogger
    ```

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    ## Workarounds
    Remove these middleware from your application
