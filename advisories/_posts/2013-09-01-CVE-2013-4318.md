  title: Features Gem for Ruby /tmp/out.html Local XSS
  date: 2013-09-01
  description: |
    Features Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a local cross-site
    scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate
    certain input upon submission to /tmp/out.html. This may allow an attacker to create
    a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's
    browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
