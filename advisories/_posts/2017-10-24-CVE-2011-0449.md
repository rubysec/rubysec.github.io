  title: Filter Problems on Case-Insensitive Filesystems in rails/actionpack
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    actionpack/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x
    before 3.0.4, when a case-insensitive filesystem is used, does not
    properly implement filters associated with the list of available
    templates, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
    restrictions via an action name that uses an unintended case for
    alphabetic characters.
