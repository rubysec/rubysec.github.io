  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute
    names and values in Phlex
  date: 2024-03-12
  description: |
    There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
    can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due
    to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent
    these attacks.

    ### Impact

    If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a
    user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript
    when clicked by another user.

    ```ruby
    a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
    ```

    If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or
    SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output,
    executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

    ```ruby
    h1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))
    ```

    ### Patches

    Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex)
    for all `1.x` minor versions. The patched versions are:

    - [1.9.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.1)
    - [1.8.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.8.2)
    - [1.7.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.7.1)
    - [1.6.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.6.2)
    - [1.5.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.5.2)
    - [1.4.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.4.1)
    - [1.3.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.3.3)
    - [1.2.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.2.2)
    - [1.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.1.1)
    - [1.0.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.0.1)

    If you are on `main`, it has been patched since
    [`aa50c60`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/aa50c604cdee1d0ce7ef068a4c66cbd5d43f96a1)

    ### Workarounds

    Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
    that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline)
    would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

    ### References

    In addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly
    recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does not
    allow `unsafe-inline`. Hereâ€™s how you can configure a Content Security
    Policy header in Rails.
