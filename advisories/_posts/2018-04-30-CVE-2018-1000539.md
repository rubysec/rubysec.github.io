  title: Auth tag forgery vulnerability with AES-GCM encrypted JWT
  date: 2018-04-30
  description: |
    Ruby's OpenSSL bindings do not check the length of the supplied
    authentication tag when decrypting an authenticated encryption mode
    such as AES-GCM, leaving this up to the authors of a gem/app to
    implement for properly validating the message.

    json-jwt was not checking for the authentication tag length, meaning
    that with a one byte tag the JWT would be considered not tampered
    with. This means that with an average of 128 (max 256) attempts an
    attacker can forge a valid signature.
