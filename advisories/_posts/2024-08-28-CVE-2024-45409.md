  title: SAML authentication bypass via Incorrect XPath selector
  date: 2024-08-28
  description: |
    Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response.
    An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML
    Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within
    the vulnerable system.
