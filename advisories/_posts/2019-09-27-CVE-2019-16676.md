  title: simple_form Gem for Ruby Incorrect Access Control for forms based on user
    input
  date: 2019-09-27
  description: |
    Simple Form before 5.0 has Incorrect Access Control in `file_method?` in `lib/simple_form/form_builder.rb`,
    because a user-supplied string is invoked as a method call.

    This only happens for pages that build forms based on user input.
  cvss_v3: 9.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 5.0"
