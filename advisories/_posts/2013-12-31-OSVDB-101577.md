  title: flukso4r Gem for Ruby /lib/flukso/R.rb Arbitrary Command Execution
  date: 2013-12-31
  description: |
    flukso4r Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/flukso/R.rb that is due
    to the application failing to properly validate user-supplied input. This may allow
    a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
  notes: No patched version
