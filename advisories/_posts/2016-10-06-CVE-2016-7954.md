  title: Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into your application via any
    secondary Gem source declared in your Gemfile
  date: 2016-10-06
  description: |
    Bundler 1.x might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary Ruby
    code into an application by leveraging a Gem name collision on a
    secondary source.

    Please note that this vulnerability only applies for Ruby
    projects using Bundler < 2.0 with Gemfiles having 2 or more
    "source" lines.

    In other words, if the user's Gemfile does not use multiple
    sources, this vulnerability can be ignored.
