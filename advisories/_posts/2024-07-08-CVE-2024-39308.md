  description: |
    ### Impact
    RailsAdmin list view has the XSS vulnerability, caused by
    improperly-escaped HTML title attribute. The issue was originally
    reported in https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/issues/3686.

    ### Patches
    Upgrade to [3.1.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_admin/versions/3.1.3)
    or [2.3.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_admin/versions/2.3.0).

    ### Workarounds
    1. Copy the index view (located under the path
       `app/views/rails_admin/main/index.html.erb`) from the RailsAdmin
       version you use, and place it into your application by using
       the same path.

    2. Open the view file by an editor, and remove `strip_tags` from
       the title attribute (as shown in GHSA advisory below).

    **Note:** The view file created by this needs to be removed after
    upgrading RailsAdmin afterwards, unless this old view continue to
    be used. Only do this if you can't upgrade RailsAdmin now for a reason.
