  title: XML Parsing Vulnerability affecting JRuby users
  date: 2013-03-19
  description: |
    The ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality supports multiple
    pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby users is
    ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM which makes use of the
    javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class. In some JVM configurations
    the default settings of that class can allow an attacker to construct
    XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary URLs
    including files from the application server. They may also allow for
    various denial of service attacks. Action Pack
