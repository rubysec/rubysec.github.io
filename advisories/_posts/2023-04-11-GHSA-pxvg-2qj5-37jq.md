  title: Update packaged libxml2 to v2.10.4 to resolve multiple CVEs

    ### Summary

    Nokogiri v1.14.3 upgrades the packaged version of its dependency libxml2 to
    [v2.10.4](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.4) from v2.10.3.

    libxml2 v2.10.4 addresses the following known vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2023-29469](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29469): Hashing of
      empty dict strings isn't deterministic
    - [CVE-2023-28484](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28484): Fix null deref
      in xmlSchemaFixupComplexType
    - Schemas: Fix null-pointer-deref in xmlSchemaCheckCOSSTDerivedOK

    Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.14.3`,
    and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation
    time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to
    your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.


    ### Mitigation

    Upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.14.3`.

    Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile
    and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.10.4` which will also address these
    same issues.


    ### Impact

    No public information has yet been published about the security-related issues other than the
    upstream commits. Examination of those changesets indicate that the more serious issues relate to
    libxml2 dereferencing NULL pointers and potentially segfaulting while parsing untrusted inputs.
