  title: Information Disclosure Through EXPLAIN Feature
  date: 2023-01-04
  description: |
    A malicious PgHero user can use the EXPLAIN functionality to extract data from
    the database. With certain inputs, a user can get the results of a query to
    appear in an error message. If the PgHero database user has superuser privileges
    (not recommended), the user can use file access functions to read files on the
    database server.
