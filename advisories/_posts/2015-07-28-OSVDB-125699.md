  title: Spree RABL templates rendering allows Arbitrary Code Execution and File Disclosure
  date: 2015-07-28
  description: |
    Spree contains a flaw where the rendering of arbitrary RABL templates
    allows for execution arbitrary files on the host system, as well as
    disclosing the existence of files on the system.
    This is a different issue than OSVDB-125701.
