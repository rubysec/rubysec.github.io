  title: Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Header Parsing
  date: 2024-02-21
  description: |
    There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing
    routines in Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2024-26146.

    Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 2.0.9.4, 2.1.4.4, 2.2.8.1, 3.0.9.1

    # Impact

    Carefully crafted headers can cause header parsing in Rack to take longer than
    expected resulting in a possible denial of service issue. `Accept` and
    `Forwarded` headers are impacted.

    Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rack applications using
    Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.

    # Releases

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    # Workarounds

    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
