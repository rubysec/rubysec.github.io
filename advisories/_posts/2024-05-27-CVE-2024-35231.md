  title: Denial of Service in rack-contrib via "profiler_runs" parameter
  date: 2024-05-27
  description: |
    rack-contrib prior to version 2.5.0 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
    via the `profiler_runs` HTTP request parameter.

    Versions Affected: < 2.5.0
    Fixed Versions: >= 2.5.0

    # Impact

    An attacker can trigger a Denial of Service by sending an HTTP request with
    an overly large `profiler_runs` parameter.

    ```shell
    curl  "http://127.0.0.1:9292/?profiler_runs=9999999999&profile=process_time"
    ```

    # Releases

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    # Workarounds

    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
