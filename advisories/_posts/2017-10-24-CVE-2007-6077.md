  title: Moderate severity vulnerability that affects rails
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in
    Rails 1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only
    attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which
    effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first
    instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct session fixation attacks.

    NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.
