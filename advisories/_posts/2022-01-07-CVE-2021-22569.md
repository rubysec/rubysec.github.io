    ## Summary

    A potential Denial of Service issue in protobuf-java was discovered in the
    parsing procedure for binary data.

    Affected versions: All versions of Java Protobufs (including Kotlin and JRuby)
    prior to the versions listed below. Protobuf "javalite" users (typically
    Android) are not affected.

    ## Severity

    **High** - An implementation weakness in how unknown fields are parsed in
    Java. A small (~800 KB) malicious payload can occupy the parser for several
    minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent,
    repeated GC pauses.

    ## Proof of Concept

    For reproduction details, please refer to the oss-fuzz issue that identifies
    the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.

    ## Remediation and Mitigation

    Please update to the latest available versions of the following packages:

    - protobuf-java (3.16.1, 3.18.2, 3.19.2)
    - protobuf-kotlin (3.18.2, 3.19.2)
    - google-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.19.2)
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.19.2"
