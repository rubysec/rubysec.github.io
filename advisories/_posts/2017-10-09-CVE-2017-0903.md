  date: 2017-10-09
  description: |
    There is a possible unsafe object deserialization vulnerability in RubyGems.
    It is possible for YAML deserialization of gem specifications to bypass class
    white lists. Specially crafted serialized objects can possibly be used to
    escalate to remote code execution.
