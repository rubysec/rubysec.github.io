  title: XSS via `translate` method of `ViewComponent::Translatable` in view_component
    gem
  date: 2022-03-02
  description: |
    This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using
    translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and
    passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly
    sanitized before display.

    Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability.

    Avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs
    before passing them.
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.31.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.49.1"
  - "~> 2.31.2"
