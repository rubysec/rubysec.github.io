  description: |
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the will_paginate gem before
    3.0.5 for Ruby allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
    vectors involving generated pagination links. It was found that ruby will_paginate
    is vulnerable to a XSS via malformed input that cause pagination to occur on an
    improper boundary. This could allow an attacker with the ability to pass data to
    the will_paginate gem to display arbitrary HTML including scripting code within
    the web interface.
