  title: Untrusted users able to run pending migrations in production
  date: 2020-06-17
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability in versions of Rails prior to 6.0.3.2 that allowed
    an untrusted user to run any pending migrations on a Rails app running in
    production.

    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2020-8185.

    Versions Affected:  6.0.0 < rails < 6.0.3.2
    Not affected:       Applications with `config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = false` (this is not a default setting in production)
    Fixed Versions:     rails >= 6.0.3.2

    Impact
    ------

    Using this issue, an attacker would be able to execute any migrations that
    are pending for a Rails app running in production mode. It is important to
    note that an attacker is limited to running migrations the application
    developer has already defined in their application and ones that have not
    already ran.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    Until such time as the patch can be applied, application developers should
    disable the ActionDispatch middleware in their production environment via
    a line such as this one in their config/environment/production.rb:

    `config.middleware.delete ActionDispatch::ActionableExceptions`
  cvss_v3: 6.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 6.0.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 6.0.3.2"
