    ### Impact

    In ActiveAdmin versions prior to 2.12.0, a concurrency issue was
    found that could allow a malicious actor to be able to access
    potentially private data that belongs to another user.

    The bug affects the functionality to export data as CSV files, and
    was caused by a variable holding the collection to be exported being
    shared across threads and not properly synchronized.

    The attacker would need access to the same ActiveAdmin application
    as the victim, and could exploit the issue by timing their request
    immediately before when they know someone else will request a CSV
    (e.g. via phishing) or request CSVs frequently and hope someone
    else makes a concurrent request.

    ### Patches

    Versions 2.12.0 and above fixed the problem by completely
    removing the shared state.
