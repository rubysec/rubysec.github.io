    CsvEnumerator class
  date: 2025-07-14
  description: |
    ### Impact

    There is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the
    `CsvEnumerator` class of the `job-iteration` repository. This
    vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
    commands on the system where the application is running, potentially
    leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system
    compromise.

    ### Patches

    Issue is fixed in versions `1.11.0` and above.

    ### Workarounds

    Users can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input
    in the `CsvEnumerator` class and ensuring that any file paths are
    properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the class
    methods. Users should avoid calling `size` on enumerators
    constructed with untrusted CSV filenames.
