  title: rgpg Gem for Ruby lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb Remote Command Execution
  date: 2013-08-02
  description: |
    rgpg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the GpgHelper module
    (lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb). The issue is due to the program failing to properly
    sanitize user-supplied input before being used in the system() function for
    execution. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
