  title: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in api response handling
  date: 2019-03-05
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2.
    Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout
    as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence
    injection may occur.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.6"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.3"
  - "~> 2.7.9"
