  title: Nokogiri gem, via libxml, is affected by DoS vulnerabilities
  date: 2018-01-29
  description: |
    The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains a
    vulnerability. Nokogiri has mitigated these issue by upgrading to
    libxml 2.9.5.

    Wei Lei discovered that libxml2 incorrecty handled certain parameter
    entities. An attacker could use this issue with specially constructed XML
    data to cause libxml2 to consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
