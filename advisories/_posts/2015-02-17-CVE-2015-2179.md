    table
  date: 2015-02-17
  description: |
    xaviershay-dm-rails Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the execute() function
    in /datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-rails/storage.rb. The issue is
    due to the function exposing sensitive information via the process table.
    This may allow a local attack to gain access to MySQL credential information.
