  title: Possible timing attack in derivation_endpoint
  description: |
    ### Impact

    When using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack
    to guess the signature of the derivation URL.

    ### Patches

    The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using
    `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade
    to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater.

    ### Workarounds

    Users of older Shrine versions can apply the following monkey-patch after loading the `derivation_endpoint` plugin:

    ```rb
    class Shrine
      class UrlSigner
        def verify_signature(string, signature)
          if signature.nil?
            fail InvalidSignature, "missing \"signature\" param"
          elsif !Rack::Utils.secure_compare(signature, generate_signature(string))
            fail InvalidSignature, "provided signature does not match the calculated signature"
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
