  title: CSRF Vulnerability with Non-Session Based Authentication
  date: 2020-08-04
  description: |
    The Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods.

    ## Impact
    The Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods,
    like basic authentication. Session-based authentication methods (like Devise's default
    authentication) are not affected.

    A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and then
    performing requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, a single endpoint is affected,
    which allows for changing the variant assigned to a user.
