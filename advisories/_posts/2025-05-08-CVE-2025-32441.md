  title: Rack session gets restored after deletion
  date: 2025-05-08
  description: |
    ### Summary

    When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack
    requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the
    unauthenticated user to occupy that session.

    ### Details

    [Rack session middleware](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/v2.2.13/lib/rack/session/abstract/id.rb#L263-L270)
    prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back
    to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application.
    This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in
    general sense over concurrent rack requests.

    ### Impact

    When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the
    attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the
    session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running
    request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out,
    in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout.

    ## Mitigation

    - Update to the latest version of `rack`, or
    - Ensure your application invalidates sessions atomically by marking
      them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of
      deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse, or
    - Implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation
      timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was
      invalidated after the request began.
