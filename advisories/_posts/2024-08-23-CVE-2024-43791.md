  title: request_store has Incorrect Default Permissions
  date: 2024-08-23
  description: |
    ### Impact

    The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666
    permissions, meaning that they are world-writable, which allows
    local users to execute arbitrary code.

    This version was published in 2017, and most production environments
    do not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being
    exploited are very low, given that the vast majority of users will
    have upgraded, and those that have not, if any, are not likely to
    be exposed.

    ### Patches

    I am not aware of any other version of the gem with incorrect
    permissions, so simply upgrading should fix the issue.

    ### Workarounds

    You could chmod the files yourself, I guess.
  cvss_v3: 7.8
