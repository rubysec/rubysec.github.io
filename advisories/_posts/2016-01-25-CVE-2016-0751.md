  title: Possible Object Leak and Denial of Service attack in Action Pack
  description: ! "There is a possible object leak which can lead to a denial of service
    \nvulnerability in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been \nassigned the CVE
    identifier CVE-2016-0751. \n\nVersions Affected:  All. \nNot affected:       None.
    \nFixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1 \n\nImpact \n------
    \nA carefully crafted accept header can cause a global cache of mime types to
    \ngrow indefinitely which can lead to a possible denial of service attack in \nAction
    Pack. \n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
    of the \nworkarounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe FIXED releases
    are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nThis attack
    can be mitigated by a proxy that only allows known mime types in \nthe Accept
    header. \n\nPlacing the following code in an initializer will also mitigate the
    issue: \n\n```ruby \nrequire 'action_dispatch/http/mime_type' \n\nMime.const_set
    :LOOKUP, Hash.new { |h,k| \n  Mime::Type.new(k) unless k.blank? \n} \n``` \n\nPatches
    \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
    patches for \nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and
    consist of a \nsingle changeset. \n\n* 5-0-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 5.0
    series \n* 4-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 4.2 series \n* 4-1-mime_types_leak.patch
    - Patch for 4.1 series \n* 3-2-mime_types_leak.patch - Patch for 3.2 series \n\nPlease
    note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users \nof
    earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
    \ncannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
    \nreleases. \n\nCredits \n------- \nAaron Patterson <3<3\n"
