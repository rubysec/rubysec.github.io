  title: Dependency Confusion in Bundler with Implicit Private Dependencies
  description: |
    Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.17 sometimes chooses a
    dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a
    rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended choice
    was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that is
    explicitly depended on by the application.
  cvss_v3: 8.8
  patched_versions:
  - "= 2.2.10"
  - ">= 2.2.18"
