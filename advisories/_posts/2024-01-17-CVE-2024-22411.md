  title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Action messages on Avo
  date: 2024-01-17
  description: |
    Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps.
    In Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or
    `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly
    without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the
    UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this
    vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an
    unsuspecting user.

    This issue has been addressed in the 3.0.2 release of Avo. Users
    are advised to upgrade.
