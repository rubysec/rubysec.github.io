  description: |
    The sanitize_css method in lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb
    in the Action Pack component in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.18, 3.0.x and 3.1.x before
    3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 does not properly handle \n (newline) characters,
    which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
    attacks via crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences. A cross-site scripting
    (XSS) flaw was found in Action Pack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
    XSS attacks against users of an application using Action Pack.
