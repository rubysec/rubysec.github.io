  date: 2018-10-04
  description: |
    Nokogiri 1.8.5 has been released.

    This is a security and bugfix release. It addresses two CVEs in upstream
    libxml2 rated as "medium" by Red Hat, for which details are below.

    If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
    vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
    though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
    (Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that these patches are not
    yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.

    Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue #1785.

    [MRI] Pulled in upstream patches from libxml2 that address CVE-2018-14404
    and CVE-2018-14567. Full details are available in #1785. Note that these
    patches are not yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.

    Description:

    A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the
    xpath.c:xmlXPathCompOpEval() function of libxml2 through 2.9.8 when
    parsing an invalid XPath expression in the XPATH_OP_AND or XPATH_OP_OR
    case. Applications processing untrusted XSL format inputs with the use of
    the libxml2 library may be vulnerable to a denial of service attack due
    to a crash of the application

    Canonical rates this vulnerability as "Priority: Medium"
