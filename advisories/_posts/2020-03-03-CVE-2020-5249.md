  title: HTTP Response Splitting (Early Hints) in Puma
  description: |
    ### Impact
    If an application using Puma allows untrusted input in an early-hints header,
    an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the header and inject
    malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body.
    This vulnerability is known as [HTTP Response
    Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting)

    While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other
    attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

    This is related to [CVE-2020-5247](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v),
    which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses.

    ### Patches
    This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.

    ### Workarounds
    Users can not allow untrusted/user input in the Early Hints response header.
