  title: Potential XSS vulnerability in Action View
  date: 2020-09-09
  description: |
    There is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action
    View's translation helpers. Views that allow the user to control the
    default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be
    susceptible to XSS attacks.

    Impact
    ------

    When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing
    translation key [named `html` or ending in `_html`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#using-safe-html-translations),
    the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped.
    Vulnerable code may look like the following examples:

    ```erb
    <%# The welcome_html translation is not defined for the current locale: %>
    <%= t("welcome_html", default: untrusted_user_controlled_string) %>

    <%# Neither the title.html translation nor the missing.html translation is defined for the current locale: %>
    <%= t("title.html", default: [:"missing.html", untrusted_user_controlled_string]) %>
    ```

    Workarounds
    -----------
    Impacted users who canâ€™t upgrade to a patched Rails version can avoid
    this issue by manually escaping default translations with the
    `html_escape` helper (aliased as `h`):

    ```erb
    <%= t("welcome_html", default: h(untrusted_user_controlled_string)) %>
    ```
