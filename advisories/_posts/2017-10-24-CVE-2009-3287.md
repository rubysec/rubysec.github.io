  title: High severity vulnerability that affects thin
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    lib/thin/connection.rb in Thin web server before 1.2.4 relies on the
    X-Forwarded-For header to determine the IP address of the client,
    which allows remote attackers to spoof the IP address and hide
    activities via a modified X-Forwarded-For header.
