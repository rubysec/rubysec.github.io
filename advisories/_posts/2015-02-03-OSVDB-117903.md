  title: Ruby-Saml Gem is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
  date: 2015-02-03
  description: |
    ruby-saml contains a flaw that is triggered as the URI value of a
    SAML response is not properly sanitized through a prepared statement.
    This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands
    on the host machine.
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.8.2"
