  title: Cross-Site Scripting in jquery
  date: 2020-09-01
  description: |
    Affected versions of `jquery` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
    This occurs because the main `jquery` function uses a regular expression
    to differentiate between HTML and selectors, but does not properly anchor
    the regular expression. The result is that `jquery` may interpret HTML
    as selectors when given certain inputs, allowing for client side code
    execution.

    ## Proof of Concept
    $("#log").html(
        $("element[attribute='<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(1)\" />']").html()
    );
