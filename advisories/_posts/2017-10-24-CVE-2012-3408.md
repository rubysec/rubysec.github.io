  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    lib/puppet/network/authstore.rb in Puppet before 2.7.18, and
    Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, supports use of IP addresses in
    certnames without warning of potential risks, which might allow
    remote attackers to spoof an agent by acquiring a previously
    used IP address.
