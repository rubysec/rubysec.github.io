  title: SpawningKit exploits
  date: 2018-06-12
  description: |
    During the spawning of a malicious Passenger-managed application, SpawningKit
    in Phusion Passenger 5.3.x before 5.3.2 allows such applications to replace
    key files or directories in the spawning communication directory with
    symlinks. This then could result in arbitrary reads and writes, which in turn
    can result in information disclosure and privilege escalation.
  cvss_v2: 7.5
  cvss_v3: 9.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 5.3.2"
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 5.3.0"
