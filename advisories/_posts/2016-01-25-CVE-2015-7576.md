  title: Timing attack vulnerability in basic authentication in Action Controller.
  description: "There is a timing attack vulnerability in the basic authentication
    support \nin Action Controller. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE \nidentifier
    CVE-2015-7576. \n\nVersions Affected:  All. \nNot affected:       None. \nFixed
    Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1 \n\nImpact \n------ \nDue
    to the way that Action Controller compares user names and passwords in \nbasic
    authentication authorization code, it is possible for an attacker to \nanalyze
    the time taken by a response and intuit the password. \n\nFor example, this string
    comparison: \n\n  \"foo\" == \"bar\" \n\nis possibly faster than this comparison:
    \n\n  \"foo\" == \"fo1\" \n\nAttackers can use this information to attempt to
    guess the username and \npassword used in the basic authentication system. \n\nYou
    can tell you application is vulnerable to this attack by looking for \n`http_basic_authenticate_with`
    method calls in your application. \n\nAll users running an affected release should
    either upgrade or use one of \nthe workarounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n--------
    \nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n-----------
    \nIf you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer
    \nthat is loaded before your application: \n\n``` \n$ cat config/initializers/basic_auth_fix.rb
    \nmodule ActiveSupport \n  module SecurityUtils \n    def secure_compare(a, b)
    \n      return false unless a.bytesize == b.bytesize \n\n      l = a.unpack \"C#{a.bytesize}\"
    \n\n      res = 0 \n      b.each_byte { |byte| res |= byte ^ l.shift } \n      res
    == 0 \n    end \n    module_function :secure_compare \n\n    def variable_size_secure_compare(a,
    b) \n      secure_compare(::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(a), ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(b))
    \n    end \n    module_function :variable_size_secure_compare \n  end \nend \n\nmodule
    ActionController \n  class Base \n    def self.http_basic_authenticate_with(options
    = {}) \n      before_action(options.except(:name, :password, :realm)) do \n        authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic(options[:realm]
    || \"Application\") do |name, password| \n          # This comparison uses & so
    that it doesn't short circuit and \n          # uses `variable_size_secure_compare`
    so that length information \n          # isn't leaked. \n          ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(name,
    options[:name]) & \n            ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare(password,
    options[:password]) \n        end \n      end \n    end \n  end \nend \n``` \n\n\nPatches
    \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
    patches for \nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and
    consist of a \nsingle changeset. \n\n* 4-1-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.1 series
    \n* 4-2-basic_auth.patch - Patch for 4.2 series \n* 5-0-basic_auth.patch - Patch
    for 5.0 series \n\nPlease note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported
    at present. Users \nof earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as
    soon as possible as we \ncannot guarantee the continued availability of security
    fixes for unsupported \nreleases. \n\nCredits \n------- \n\nThank you to Daniel
    Waterworth for reporting the problem and working with us to \nfix it.\n"
