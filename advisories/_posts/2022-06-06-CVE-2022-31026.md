  description: |
    ### Impact

    When authenticating, a malicious server could return a specially crafted authentication
    packet, causing the client to read and return up to 12 bytes of data from an
    uninitialized variable in stack memory.

    ### Patches

    Users of the trilogy gem should upgrade to version 2.1.1

    ### Workarounds

    This issue can be avoided by only connecting to trusted servers.
