  date: 2012-05-31
  description: |
    actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before
    3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly consider differences
    in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the Rack interface,
    which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and
    perform NULL checks via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values,
    a related issue to CVE-2012-2694.
  cvss_v2: 7.5
