  title: Missing TLS certificate verification in faye-websocket
  description: |
    The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the [`EM::Connection#start_tls`][1]
    method in [EventMachine][2] to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL
    is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate
    verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents
    a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that
    any `wss:` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a
    man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server
    it is connected to.

    This has been a requested feature in EventMachine for many years now; see for
    example [#275][3], [#378][4], and [#814][5]. In June 2020, [em-http-request][6]
    published an [advisory][7] related to this problem and fixed it by [implementing
    TLS verification][8] in their own codebase; although EventMachine does not
    implement certificate verification itself, it provides an extension point for
    the caller to implement it, called [`ssl_verify_peer`][9]. Based on this
    implementation, we have incorporated similar functionality into [faye-websocket
    for Ruby][10], such that we use the `OpenSSL` module to perform two checks:

    - The chain of certificates presented by the server is valid and ultimately
      trusted by your root certificate set -- either your system default root
      certificates, or a set provided at runtime
    - The final certificate presented by the server is valid for the hostname used
      in the request URI; if the connection is made via a proxy we use the hostname
      from the request, not the proxy's hostname

    After implementing verification in v1.1.6, em-http-request has elected to leave
    the `:verify_peer` option switched off by default. We have decided to _enable_
    this option by default in faye-websocket, but are publishing a minor release
    with added functionality for configuring it. We are mindful of the fact that
    this may break existing programs, but we consider it much more important that
    all clients have TLS verification turned on by default. A client that is not
    carrying out verification is either:

    - talking to the expected server, and will not break under this change
    - being attacked, and would benefit from being alerted to this fact
    - deliberately talking to a server that would be rejected by verification

    The latter case includes situations like talking to a non-public server using a
    self-signed certificate. We consider this use case to be "working by accident",
    rather than functionality that was actively supported, and it should be properly
    and explicitly supported instead. To that end, we have added two new options to
    the `Faye::WebSocket::Client` constructor: `tls.root_cert_file`, and
    `tls.verify_peer`.

    The `:root_cert_file` option lets you provide a different set of root
    certificates in situations where you don't want to use your system's default
    root certificates to verify the remote host. It should be a path or an array of
    paths identifying the certificates to use instead of the defaults.

    ```rb
    client = Faye::WebSocket::Client.new('wss://example.com/', [], tls: {
      root_cert_file: 'path/to/certificate.pem'
    })
    ```

    The `:verify_peer` option lets you turn verification off entirely. This should
    be a last resort and we recommend using the `:root_cert_file` option if
    possible.

    ```rb
    client = Faye::WebSocket::Client.new('wss://example.com/', [], tls: {
      verify_peer: false
    })
    ```

    To get the new behaviour, please upgrade to v0.11.0 of the [Rubygems
    package][10]. There are, unfortunately, no workarounds for this issue, as you
    cannot enable `:verify_peer` in EventMachine unless the calling library contains
    an implementation of `ssl_verify_peer` that actually checks the server's
    certificates.

    For further background information on this issue, please see [faye#524][12] and
    [faye-websocket#129][13]. We would like to thank [Tero Marttila][14] and [Daniel
    Morsing][15] for providing invaluable assistance and feedback on this issue.
