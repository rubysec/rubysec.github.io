  date: 2015-05-14
  description: RubyGems 2.0.x before 2.0.16, 2.2.x before 2.2.4, and 2.4.x before
    2.4.7 does not validate the hostname when fetching gems or making API requests,
    which allows remote attackers to redirect requests to arbitrary domains via a
    crafted DNS SRV record, aka a "DNS hijack attack." A flaw was found in a way rubygems
    verified the API endpoint hostname retrieved through a DNS SRV record. A man-in-the-middle
    attacker could use this flaw to force a client to download content from an untrusted
    domain.
