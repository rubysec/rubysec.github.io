  title: Keepalive Connections Causing Denial Of Service in puma
  description: |
    ### Impact

    The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected
    existing connections that had already been accepted from having their
    requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in
    the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy
    persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the
    cluster.

    A puma server which received more concurrent keep-alive connections than the
    server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of
    connections, denying service to the unserved connections.

    ### Patches

    This problem has been fixed in puma 4.3.8 and 5.3.1.

    ### Workarounds

    Setting queue_requests false also fixes the issue. This is not advised when
    using puma without a reverse proxy, such as nginx or apache, because you will
    open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. [slowloris][1]).

    The fix is very small. [A git patch is available here][2] for those using
    [unsupported versions][3] of Puma.
