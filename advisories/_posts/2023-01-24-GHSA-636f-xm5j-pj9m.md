    ## Impact

    Several quadratic complexity bugs in commonmarker's underlying [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)
    library may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

    The following vulnerabilities were addressed:

    * [CVE-2023-22483](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-29g3-96g3-jg6c)
