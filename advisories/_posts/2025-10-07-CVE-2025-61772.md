  title: Rack's multipart parser buffers unbounded per-part headers, enabling DoS
    (memory exhaustion)
  date: 2025-10-07
  description: |
    ## Summary

    `Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a
    multipart partâ€™s header block never terminates with the required
    blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes
    to memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust
    memory and cause a denial of service (DoS).

    ## Details

    While reading multipart headers, the parser waits for `CRLFCRLF` using:

    ```ruby
    @sbuf.scan_until(/(.*?\r
    )\r
    /m)
    ```

    If the terminator never appears, it continues appending data
    (`@sbuf.concat(content)`) indefinitely. There is no limit on
    accumulated header bytes, so a single malformed part can consume
    memory proportional to the request body size.

    ## Impact

    Attackers can send incomplete multipart headers to trigger high memory
    use, leading to process termination (OOM) or severe slowdown. The
    effect scales with request size limits and concurrency. All
    applications handling multipart uploads may be affected.

    ## Mitigation

    * Upgrade to a patched Rack version that caps per-part header size
      (e.g., 64 KiB).

    * Until then, restrict maximum request sizes at the proxy or web
      server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).
