  title: Rack has an unsafe default in Rack::QueryParser allows params_limit bypass
    via semicolon-separated parameters
  date: 2025-09-25
  description: |
    ## Summary

    `Rack::QueryParser` in version `< 2.2.18` enforces its `params_limit`
    only for parameters separated by `&`, while still splitting on both
    `&` and `;`. As a result, attackers could use `;` separators to
    bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended.

    ## Details

    The issue arises because `Rack::QueryParser#check_query_string`
    counts only `&` characters when determining the number of parameters,
    but the default separator regex `DEFAULT_SEP = /[&;] */n` splits on
    both `&` and `;`. This mismatch means that queries using `;`
    separators were not included in the parameter count, allowing
    `params_limit` to be bypassed.

    Other safeguards (`bytesize_limit` and `key_space_limit`) still
    applied, but did not prevent this particular bypass.

    ## Impact

    Applications or middleware that directly invoke `Rack::QueryParser`
    with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be
    exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused
    as a limited denial-of-service vector.

    `Rack::Request`, the primary entry point for typical Rack applications,
    uses `QueryParser` in a safe way and does not appear vulnerable by
    default. As such, the severity is considered **low**, with the impact
    limited to edge cases where `QueryParser` is used directly.

    ## Mitigation

    * Upgrade to a patched version of Rack where both `&` and `;` are
      counted consistently toward `params_limit`.
    * If upgrading is not immediately possible, configure `QueryParser`
      with an explicit delimiter (e.g., `&`) to avoid the mismatch.
    * As a general precaution, enforce query string and request size
      limits at the web server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or
      a CDN) to mitigate excessive parsing overhead.
