  title: Malicious URL drafting attack against iodines static file server may allow
    path traversal
  date: 2019-10-07
  description: |2

    ### Impact

    A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static
    file service. This vulnerability effects any application running
    iodine's static file server on an effected iodine version.

    Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt
    a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally
    accessible from the public folder.

    ### Patches

    The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34. Please upgrade
    to the latest version.

    ### Workarounds

    A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service
    and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx
    or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically).

    However, it would be better to upgrade iodine to the latest
    version, as it also contains non-security related fixes.
