  title: Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job
  date: 2018-11-27
  description: |
    There is a vulnerability in Active Job. This vulnerability has been
    assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-16476.

    Versions Affected: >= 4.2.0
    Not affected: < 4.2.0
    Fixed Versions: 4.2.11, 5.0.7.1, 5.1.6.1, 5.2.1.1

    Impact
    ------
    Carefully crafted user input can cause Active Job to deserialize it using GlobalId
    and allow an attacker to have access to information that they should not have.

    Vulnerable code will look something like this:

        MyJob.perform_later(user_input)

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.
