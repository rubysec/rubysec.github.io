  date: 2023-03-31
  description: |
    A ReDoS issue was discovered in the Time component through 0.2.1 in Ruby
    through 3.2.1. The Time parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters.
    It causes an increase in execution time for parsing strings to Time objects. The
    fixed versions are 0.1.1 and 0.2.2.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 0.1.1"
  - ">= 0.2.2"
