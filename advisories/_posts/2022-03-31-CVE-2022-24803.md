  title: Command Injection vulnerability in asciidoctor-include-ext
  date: 2022-03-31
  description: |
    ### Impact

    Applications using [Asciidoctor (Ruby)](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor)
    with [asciidoctor-include-ext](https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-include-ext)
    (prior to version 0.4.0), which render user-supplied input in AsciiDoc markup, may
    allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the host operating system.
    This attack is possible even when `allow-uri-read` is disabled!

    ### Patches

    The vulnerability has been fixed in commit c7ea001 (and further improved in cbaccf3),
    which is included in version
    [0.4.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-include-ext/versions/0.4.0).

    ### Workarounds

    ```rb
    require 'asciidoctor/include_ext'

    class Asciidoctor::IncludeExt::IncludeProcessor
      # Overrides superclass private method to mitigate Command Injection
      # vulnerability in asciidoctor-include-ext <0.4.0.
      def target_uri?(target)
        target.downcase.start_with?('http://', 'https://') \
          && URI.parse(target).is_a?(URI::HTTP)
      rescue URI::InvalidURIError
        false
      end
    end
    ```
