  title: Possible code injection vulnerability in Rails / Active Storage
  date: 2022-03-08
  description: |
    There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
    of Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2022-21831.

    Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
    Not affected:       < 5.2.0
    Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.3, 6.1.4.7, 6.0.4.7, 5.2.6.3

    Impact
    ------
    There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
    of Rails.  This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage
    with the image_processing processing in addition to the mini_magick back end
    for image_processing.

    Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:

    ```ruby
    <%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] => params[:v]) %>
    ```

    Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary
    input.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    To work around this issue, applications should implement a strict allow-list
    on accepted transformation methods or arguments.  Additionally, a strict image
    magick security policy will help mitigate this issue.
