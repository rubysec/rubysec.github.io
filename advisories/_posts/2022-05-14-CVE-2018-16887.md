    of Satellite. An attacker with privilege to create/edit organizations and locations
    is able to execute a XSS attacks against other users through the Subscriptions or
    the Red Hat Repositories wizards. This can possibly lead to malicious code execution
    and extraction of the anti-CSRF token of higher privileged users. Versions before
    3.9.0 are vulnerable.
