    ## Impact

    The REXML gem before 3.3.9 has a ReDoS vulnerability when it
    parses an XML that has many digits between `&#` and `x...;`
    in a hex numeric character reference (`&#x...;`).

    This does not happen with Ruby 3.2 or later. Ruby 3.1 is the only
    affected maintained Ruby. Note that Ruby 3.1 will reach EOL on 2025-03.

    ## Patches

    The REXML gem 3.3.9 or later include the patch to fix the vulnerability.

    ## Workarounds

    Use Ruby 3.2 or later instead of Ruby 3.1.
