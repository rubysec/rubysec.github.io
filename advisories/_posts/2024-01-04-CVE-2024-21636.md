    ### Impact
    _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

    This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact
    anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the
    view_component gem. Note that only components that define a
    [`#call` method](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/templates.html#call)
    (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return
    value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include
    user-defined content.

    In addition, the return value of the
    [`#output_postamble` method](https://viewcomponent.org/api.html#output_postamble--string)
    is not sanitized, which can also lead to XSS issues.

    ### Patches
    _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

    Versions 3.9.0 has been released and fully mitigates both the
    `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities.

    ### Workarounds
    _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability
    without upgrading?_

    Sanitize the return value of `#call`, eg:

    ```ruby
    class MyComponent < ApplicationComponent
      def call
        html_escape("<div>#{user_input}</div>")
      end
    end
    ```
