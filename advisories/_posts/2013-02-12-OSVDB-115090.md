  title: Bundler Gem for Ruby Missing SSL Certificate Validation MitM Spoofing
  date: 2013-02-12
  description: |
    Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as SSL certificates are not properly
    validated. By spoofing the SSL server via a certificate that appears valid,
    an attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS
    cache poisoning) can disclose and optionally manipulate transmitted data.
