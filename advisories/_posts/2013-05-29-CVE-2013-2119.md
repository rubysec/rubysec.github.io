  description: |
    Phusion Passenger gem before 3.0.21 and 4.0.x before 4.0.5 for Ruby allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (prevent application start) or gain privileges
    by pre-creating a temporary "config" file in a directory with a predictable name
    in /tmp/ before it is used by the gem.
  cvss_v2: 4.6
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 3.0.21"
  - ">= 4.0.5"
