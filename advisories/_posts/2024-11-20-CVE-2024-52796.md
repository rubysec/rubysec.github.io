  title: Password Pusher rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers

  description: |
    ### Impact

    Password Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter.
    In versions prior to [v1.49.0], the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging
    proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site
    potentially causing a denial of service.

    ### Patches

    In [v1.49.0], a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which
    resolves this issue.

    If you are running a remote proxy, please see
    [this documentation](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies)
    on how to authorize the IP address of your remote proxy.

    ### Workarounds

    It is highly suggested to upgrade to at least [v1.49.0] to mitigate this risk.

    If for some reason you cannot immediately upgrade, the alternative
    is that you can add rules to your proxy and/or firewall to not
    accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.

    ### References

    The new settings are [configurable to authorize remote proxies][1].
