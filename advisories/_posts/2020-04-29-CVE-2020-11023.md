    ## Impact

    Passing HTML containing `<option>` elements from untrusted sources - even after
    sanitizing them - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`,
    `.append()`, and others) may execute untrusted code.

    ## Workarounds

    To workaround this issue without upgrading, use DOMPurify with its
    `SAFE_FOR_JQUERY` option to sanitize the HTML string before passing it to a
    jQuery method.
