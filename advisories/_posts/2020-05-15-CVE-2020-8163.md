  title: Potential remote code execution of user-provided local names in ActionView
  date: 2020-05-15
  description: |
    There was a vulnerability in versions of Rails prior to 5.0.1 that would
    allow an attacker who controlled the `locals` argument of a `render` call.

    Versions Affected:  rails < 5.0.1
    Not affected:       Applications that do not allow users to control the names of locals.
    Fixed Versions:     4.2.11.2

    Impact
    ------

    In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the name of a
    local passed into `render`, they can acheive remote code execution.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    Until such time as the patch can be applied, application developers should
    ensure that all user-provided local names are alphanumeric.
  cvss_v3: 8.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.2.11.2"
