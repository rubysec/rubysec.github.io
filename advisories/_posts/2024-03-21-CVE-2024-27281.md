  title: RCE vulnerability with .rdoc_options in RDoc
  date: 2024-03-21
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby
    3.x through 3.3.0.

    When parsing `.rdoc_options` (used for configuration in RDoc) as a YAML file,
    object injection and resultant remote code execution are possible because
    there are no restrictions on the classes that can be restored.

    When loading the documentation cache, object injection and resultant remote
    code execution are also possible if there were a crafted cache.

    We recommend to update the RDoc gem to version 6.6.3.1 or later. In order to
    ensure compatibility with bundled version in older Ruby series, you may
    update as follows instead:

    * For Ruby 3.0 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.3.4.1
    * For Ruby 3.1 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.4.1.1
    * For Ruby 3.2 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.5.1.1

    You can use `gem update rdoc` to update it. If you are using bundler, please
    add `gem "rdoc", ">= 6.6.3.1"` to your `Gemfile`.

    Note: 6.3.4, 6.4.1, 6.5.1 and 6.6.3 have a incorrect fix. We recommend to
    upgrade 6.3.4.1, 6.4.1.1, 6.5.1.1 and 6.6.3.1 instead of them.
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 6.3.4, >= 6.3.4.1"
  - "~> 6.4.1, >= 6.4.1.1"
  - ">=  6.5.1.1"
