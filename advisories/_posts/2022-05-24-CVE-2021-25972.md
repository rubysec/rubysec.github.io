  title: Camaleon CMS vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
  date: 2022-05-24
  description: |
    In Camaleon CMS, versions 2.1.2.0 through 2.6.0, are vulnerable to Server-Side
    Request Forgery (SSRF) in the media upload feature, which allows admin users to
    fetch media files from external URLs but fails to validate URLs referencing to localhost
    or other internal servers. This allows attackers to read files stored in the internal
    server.
  cvss_v3: 4.9
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.1.2.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.6.0.1"
