    with QuillJS WYSWYG editor
  date: 2024-09-16
  description: |
    ### Impact
    The WYSWYG editor QuillJS is subject to potential XSS attach in
    case the attacker manages to modify the HTML before being
    uploaded to the server.

    The attacker is able to change e.g. to <svg onload=alert('XSS')>
    if they know how to craft these requests themselves.

    ### Patches
    N/A

    ### Workarounds
    Review the user accounts that have access to the admin panel (i.e.
    general Administrators, and participatory space's Administrators)
    and remove access to them if they don't need it.

    Disable the "Enable rich text editor for participants" setting in
    the admin dashboard.
