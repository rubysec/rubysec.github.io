  title: Doorkeeper Gem for Ruby stores sensitive information in production logs
  date: 2015-02-10
  description: |
    Doorkeeper Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in lib/doorkeeper/engine.rb.
    The issue is due to the program storing sensitive information in
    production logs. This may allow a local attacker to gain access to
    sensitive information.
