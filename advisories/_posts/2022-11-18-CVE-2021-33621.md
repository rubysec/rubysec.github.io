  title: HTTP response splitting in CGI
  date: 2022-11-18
  description: |-
    cgi.rb in Ruby through 2.6.x, through 3.0x, and through 3.1.x allows HTTP
    header injection. If a CGI application using the CGI library inserts
    untrusted input into the HTTP response header, an attacker can exploit it to
    insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to
    deceive clients.
