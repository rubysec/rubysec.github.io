  title: Buffer overflow in sponge queue functions
  date: 2023-04-26
  description: |
    Impact
      The Keccak sponge function interface accepts partial inputs to be
      absorbed and partial outputs to be squeezed. A buffer can overflow
      when partial data with some specific sizes are queued, where at
      least one of them has a length of 2^32 - 200 bytes or more.
    Patches
      Yes, see commit [fdc6fef0](https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/commit/fdc6fef075f4e81d6b1bc38364248975e08e340a).
    Workarounds
      The problem can be avoided by limiting the size of the partial
      input data (or partial output digest) below 2^32 - 200 bytes.
      Multiple calls to the queue system can be chained at a higher
      level to retain the original functionality. Alternatively, one
      can process the entire input (or produce the entire output) at
      once, avoiding the queuing functions altogether.
