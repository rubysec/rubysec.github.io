  description: |
    Bundler before 1.7, when multiple top-level source lines are used, allows
    remote attackers to install arbitrary gems by creating a gem with the same name
    as another gem in a different source. A flaw was found in the way Bundler handled
    gems available from multiple sources. An attacker with access to one of the sources
    could create a malicious gem with the same name, which they could then use to trick
    a user into installing, potentially resulting in execution of code from the attacker-supplied
    malicious gem.
