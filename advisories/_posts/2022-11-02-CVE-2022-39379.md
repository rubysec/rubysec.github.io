  title: fluentd vulnerable to remote code execution due to insecure deserialization
    (in non-default configuration)
  date: 2022-11-02
  description: |
    ### Impact
    A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of
    Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via
    specially crafted JSON payloads.

    Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable
    `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`.

    Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd
    version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this
    vulnerability.

    ### Patches
    v1.15.3

    ### Workarounds
    Do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.
