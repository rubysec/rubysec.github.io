  date: 2019-12-26
  description: |
    The bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails gem includes the vendored JavaScript library 'handlebars.js'.
    Versions 0.3.3.7-0.3.3.8 include handlebars 3.0.2, and versions 0.3.3.5-0.3.3.6 include handlebars 1.3.0.

    Versions Affected: 0.3.3.5-0.3.3.8
    Not affected: < 0.3.3.5
    Fixed Versions: None

    Versions of handlebars prior to 3.0.8 or 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution.
    Templates may alter an Objects' __proto__ and __defineGetter__ properties, which may allow an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code through crafted payloads.
  cvss_v3: 9.8
