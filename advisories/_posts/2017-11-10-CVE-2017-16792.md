  title: Stored XSS in "geminabox" via injection in Gemspec "homepage" value
  date: 2017-11-10
  description: |
    Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "geminabox" (Gem
    in a Box) allows attackers to inject arbitrary web script via a crafted
    JavaScript URL in the "homepage" value of a ".gemspec" file.

    A ".gemspec" file must be created with a JavaScript URL in the homepage
    value. This can be used to build a gem for upload to the Geminabox server,
    in order to achieve stored XSS via the gem hyperlink.
