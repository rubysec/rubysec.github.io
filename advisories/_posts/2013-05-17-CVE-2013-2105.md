  title: Show In Browser Gem for Ruby /tmp/browser.html Arbitrary Script Injection
  date: 2013-05-17
  description: |
    Show In Browser Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when the
    application does not validate input passed via the /tmp/browser.html file. This
    may allow a local attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute
    arbitrary script code in a user's browser.
