  title: Screen Capture Gem for Ruby screen_capture.rb URL Handling Arbitrary Command
    Execution
  date: 2014-06-07
  description: |
    Screen Capture Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in screen_capture.rb that
    is triggered when handling input passed via the URL. This may allow
    a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
  notes: Never patched
