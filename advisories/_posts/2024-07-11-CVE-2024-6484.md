  date: 2024-07-11
  description: |
    A vulnerability has been identified in Bootstrap that exposes users
    to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The issue is present in the
    carousel component, where the data-slide and data-slide-to attributes
    can be exploited through the href attribute of an <a> tag due to
    inadequate sanitization. This vulnerability could potentially enable
    attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser.
