  description: |
    The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x
    before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of
    request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers
    to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
    unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.
