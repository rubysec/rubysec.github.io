  title: Insufficient URI encoding in restforce
  date: 2018-07-27
  description: |
    A flaw in how restforce constructs URL's may allow an attacker to inject
    additional parameters into Salesforce API requests.

    Impact
    ------
    This flaw is only exploitable in applications that pass user input directly
    to restforce's select, find, describe, update, upsert, and destroy methods.
    Vulnerable code might look like:

    ```ruby
    client.select('SomeSalesForceObject', params[:some-id],
       ...)
    ```

    In such an application, attackers could pass `0016000000MRatd/describe`
    as a request parameter, causing the server to make a request to a different
    endpoint than the server is designed to handle. Since the Salesforce REST
    API supports overriding HTTP methods via a request parameter, an attacker
    could also cause the client's `select()` method to modify data, by passing
    `0016000000MRatd/?_HttpMethod=PATCH&other-query-params=...`.

    Workarounds
    ------
    If possible, applications should track salesforce IDs internally, rather than
    passing user-supplied IDs to salesforce. Such practice mitigates this
    vulnerability, and in general is desirable for ensuring strong access control.
