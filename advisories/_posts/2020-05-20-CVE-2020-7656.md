  title: Cross-Site Scripting in jquery
  date: 2020-05-20
  description: |
    Versions of `jquery` prior to 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting. The load method fails to recognize and remove "<script>"
    HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, i.e: "</script >",
    which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. This
    allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.
