  title: Arbitrary file existence disclosure in Action Pack
  date: 2014-10-30
  description: |
    Specially crafted requests can be used to determine whether a file exists on
    the filesystem that is outside the Rails application's root directory.  The
    files will not be served, but attackers can determine whether or not the file
    exists.
