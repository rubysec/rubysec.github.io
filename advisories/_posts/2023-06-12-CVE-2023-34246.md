  title: Doorkeeper Improper Authentication vulnerability
  date: 2023-06-12
  description: |
    OAuth RFC 8252 says  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-8.6

    > the authorization server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests
    > automatically without user consent or interaction, except when the
    > identity of the client can be assured. **This includes the case
    > where the user has previously approved an authorization request
    > for a given client id**

    But Doorkeeper automatically processes authorization requests without
    user consent for public clients that have been previous approved.
    Public clients are inherently  vulnerable to impersonation, their
    identity cannot be assured.
