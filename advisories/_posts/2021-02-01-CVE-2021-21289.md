  title: Mechanize ruby gem Command Injection vulnerability
  date: 2021-02-01
  description: |
    ## Impact

    Mechanize `>= v2.0`, `< v2.7.7` allows for OS commands to be injected using several
    classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Exploitation is
    possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of
    these calls:

    * Mechanize::CookieJar#load: since v2.0 (see 208e3ed)
    * Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as: since v2.0 (see 5b776a4)
    * Mechanize#download: since v2.2 (see dc91667)
    * Mechanize::Download#save and #save! since v2.1 (see 98b2f51, bd62ff0)
    * Mechanize::File#save and #save_as: since v2.1 (see 2bf7519)
    * Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body: since v2.0 (see 01039f5)

    ## Patches

    These vulnerabilities are patched in Mechanize v2.7.7.

    ## Workarounds

    No workarounds are available. We recommend upgrading to v2.7.7 or later.

    ## References

    See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_security.html#securityopen for background
    on why `Kernel.open` should not be used with untrusted input.
