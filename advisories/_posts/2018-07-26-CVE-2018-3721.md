  title: Prototype Pollution in lodash
  date: 2018-07-26
  description: |
    Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.5 are vulnerable to
    prototype pollution.

    The vulnerable functions are 'defaultsDeep', 'merge', and
    'mergeWith' which allow a malicious user to modify the
    prototype of `Object` via `__proto__` causing the addition
    or modification of an existing property that will exist
    on all objects.

    ## Recommendation

    Update to version 4.17.5 or later."
  cvss_v2: 4.0
  cvss_v3: 6.5
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.17.5"
