  title: MiniMagick Gem for Ruby URI Handling Arbitrary Command Injection
  date: 2013-03-12
  description: |
    MiniMagick Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered during the handling
    of specially crafted input from an untrusted source passed via a URL that
    contains a ';' character. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to
    potentially execute arbitrary commands.
