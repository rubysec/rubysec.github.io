    ## Vulnerability type: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special

    Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

    ## Vendor:

    Decidim International
    Community Environment

    ### Has vendor conﬁrmed: Yes

    ### Attack type: Remote

    ### Impact:

    Code Execution
    Escalation of Privileges
    Information Disclosure

    ### Aﬀected component:

    A raw sql-statement that uses an interpolated variable
    exists in the admin_role_actions method of the
    `papertrail/version-model(app/models/decidim/decidim_awesome/paper_trail_version.rb`).

    ### Attack vector:

    An attacker with admin permissions could manipulate database queries
    in order to read out the database, read ﬁles from the ﬁlesystem,
    write ﬁles from the ﬁlesystem. In the worst case, this could lead
    to remote code execution on the server.

      admin user to manipulate sql queries\nto disclose information,
      read and write ﬁles or execute commands.
