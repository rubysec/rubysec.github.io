  title: YARD's default template vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting in generated frames.html
  date: 2024-02-28
  description: |2

    ### Summary

    The "frames.html" file within the Yard Doc's generated documentation
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to inadequate
    sanitization of user input within the JavaScript segment of the
    "frames.erb" template file.

    ### Details

    The vulnerability stems from mishandling user-controlled data retrieved
    from the URL hash in the embedded JavaScript code within the "frames.erb"
    template file. Specifically, the script lacks proper sanitization of
    the hash data before utilizing it to establish the top-level window's
    location. This oversight permits an attacker to inject malicious
    JavaScript payloads through carefully crafted URLs.

    Snippet from "frames.erb":
    ```erb
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var match = unescape(window.location.hash).match(/^#!(.+)/);
      var name = match ? match[1] : '<= url_for_main >';
      name = name.replace(/^(\w+):\/\//, '').replace(/^\/\//, '');
      window.top.location = name;
    </script>
    ```

    ### PoC (Proof of Concept)

    To exploit this vulnerability:
    1. Gain access to the generated Yard Doc.
    2. Locate and access the "frames.html" file.
    3. Construct a URL containing the malicious payload in the hash
       segment, for instance: `#!javascript:xss`

    ### Impact

    This XSS vulnerability presents a substantial threat by enabling
    an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's
    session context. Potential ramifications include session hijacking,
    theft of sensitive data, unauthorized access to user accounts, and
    defacement of websites. Any user visiting the compromised page is
    susceptible to exploitation. It is critical to promptly address
    this vulnerability to mitigate potential harm to users and preserve
    the application's integrity.
