  title: Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller
  date: 2024-02-21
  description: |
    There is a possible XSS vulnerability when using the translation helpers
    (`translate`, `t`, etc) in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been
    assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26143.

    Versions Affected: >= 7.0.0
    Not affected: < 7.0.0
    Fixed Versions: 7.1.3.1, 7.0.8.1

    # Impact

    Applications using translation methods like `translate`, or `t` on a
    controller, with a key ending in “_html”, a `:default` key which contains
    untrusted user input, and the resulting string is used in a view, may be
    susceptible to an XSS vulnerability.

    For example, impacted code will look something like this:

    ```
    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      def show
        @message = t("message_html", default: untrusted_input)
        # The `show` template displays the contents of `@message`
      end
    end
    ```

    To reiterate the pre-conditions, applications must:

    * Use a translation function from a controller (i.e. *not* `I18n.t`, or
    `t` from a view)
    * Use a key that ends in `_html`
    * Use a default value where the default value is untrusted and unescaped input
    * Send the text to the victim (whether that’s part of a template, or a
      `render` call)

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

    # Releases

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    # Workarounds
