  title: pubnub Insufficient Entropy vulnerability
  date: 2023-12-06
  description: |
    Versions of the package pubnub before 7.4.0; all versions of the
    package com.pubnub:pubnub; versions of the package pubnub before
    6.19.0; all versions of the package github.com/pubnub/go; versions
    of the package github.com/pubnub/go/v7 before 7.2.0; versions of
    the package pubnub before 7.3.0; versions of the package pubnub/pubnub
    before 6.1.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.3.0; versions
    of the package pubnub before 0.4.0; versions of the package pubnub/c-core
    before 4.5.0; versions of the package com.pubnub:pubnub-kotlin before
    7.7.0; versions of the package pubnub/swift before 6.2.0; versions
    of the package pubnub before 5.2.0; versions of the package pubnub
    before 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy via the getKey
    function, due to inefficient implementation of the AES-256-CBC
    cryptographic algorithm. The provided encrypt function is less secure
    when hex encoding and trimming are applied, leaving half of the bits
    in the key always the same for every encoded message or file.

    **Note:**

    In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to invest
    resources in preparing the attack and brute-force the encryption.
