  date: 2013-01-28
  description: |
    lib/active_support/json/backends/yaml.rb in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before
    2.3.16 and 3.0.x before 3.0.20 does not properly convert JSON data to YAML data
    for processing by a YAML parser, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code, conduct SQL injection attacks, or bypass authentication via crafted data that
    triggers unsafe decoding, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0156.
