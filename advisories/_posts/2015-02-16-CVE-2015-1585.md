  title: Fat Free CRM Gem being vulnerable to CSRF-type attacks
  date: 2015-02-16
  description: |
    Fat Free CRM contains a flaw as HTTP requests to /admin/users do not require
    multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing
    certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following a specially
    crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to creating administrative
    users.
