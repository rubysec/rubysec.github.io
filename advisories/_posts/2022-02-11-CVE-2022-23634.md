  title: Information Exposure with Puma when used with Rails
  date: 2022-02-11
  description: |
    ### Impact

    Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call
    `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the
    response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to
    work correctly.

    From Rails:

    > Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example
    > a bug in a webserver[1] or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a
    > response is not notified of a close, ActionDispatch::Executor will not know
    > to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data
    > being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with
    > ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.

    The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails'
    Executor implementation) causes information leakage.

    ### Patches

    This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11.

    This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

    See: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9
    for details about the rails vulnerability

    Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability.

    ### Workarounds

    Upgrade to Rails versions 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

    includes a middleware that can be used instead.
