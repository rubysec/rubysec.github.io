  description: |
    active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.15,
    3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does not properly
    restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct object-injection
    attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
    consumption) involving nested XML entity references, by leveraging Action Pack support
    for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion.
