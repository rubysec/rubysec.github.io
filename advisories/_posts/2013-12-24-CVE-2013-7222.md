  title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby lack of support for cycling the Rails session secret
  date: 2013-12-24
  description: |
    Fat Free CRM contains a flaw that is due to the application defining a static
    security session token in config/initialiers/secret_token.rb. If a remote
    attacker has explicit knowledge of this token, they can potentially execute
    arbitrary code.
