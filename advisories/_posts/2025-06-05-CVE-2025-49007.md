    ### Summary

    There is a denial of service vulnerability in the
    Content-Disposition parsing component of Rack. This is very
    similar to the previous security issue CVE-2022-44571.

    ### Details

    Carefully crafted input can cause Content-Disposition header
    parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly
    resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is
    used typically used in multipart parsing. Any applications that
    parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications)
    are impacted.
