  title: Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware
  date: 2021-12-14
  description: |
    There is a possible open redirect vulnerability in the Host Authorization
    middleware in Action Pack.

    Specially crafted "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain
    "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action
    Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

    Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. For example,
    configuration files that look like this:

    ```
    config.hosts <<  '.EXAMPLE.com'
    ```

    When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted Host header
    can be used to redirect to a malicious website.

    This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-22881 and CVE-2021-22942.
