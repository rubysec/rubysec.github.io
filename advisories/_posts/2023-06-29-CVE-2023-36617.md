  title: ReDoS vulnerability in URI
  date: 2023-06-29
  description: |
    We have released the uri gem version 0.12.2, 0.10.3 that has a
    security fix for a ReDoS vulnerability. This vulnerability has
    been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-36617.

    Details

    A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component through 0.12.1
    for Ruby. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific
    characters. There is an increase in execution time for parsing
    strings to URI objects with rfc2396_parser.rb and rfc3986_parser.rb.

    NOTE: this issue exists becuse of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28755.

    The uri gem version 0.12.1 and all versions prior 0.12.1 are
    vulnerable for this vulnerability.

    Recommended action

    We recommend to update the uri gem to 0.12.2.
    In order to ensure compatibility with bundled version in older
    Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:

    * For Ruby 3.0: Update to uri 0.10.3
    * For Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: Update to uri 0.12.2
      You can use gem update uri to update it. If you are using bundler,
      please add gem "uri", ">= 0.12.2" (or other version mentioned
      above) to your Gemfile.

    * Affected versions: uri gem 0.12.1 or before
