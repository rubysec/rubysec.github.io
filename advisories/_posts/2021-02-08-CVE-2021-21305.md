  title: Code Injection vulnerability in CarrierWave::RMagick
  description: |
    ### Impact
    [CarrierWave::RMagick](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/lib/carrierwave/processing/rmagick.rb)
    has a Code Injection vulnerability. Its `#manipulate!` method inappropriately evals the content of mutation
    option(`:read`/`:write`), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code.
    If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE).

    (But supplying untrusted input to the option itself is dangerous even in absence of this vulnerability, since is prone to
    DoS vulnerability - attackers can try to consume massive amounts of memory by resizing to a very large dimension)

    ### Proof of Concept
    ```ruby
    class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
      include CarrierWave::RMagick
    end

    MyUploader.new.manipulate!({ read: { density: "1 }; p 'Hacked'; {" }}) # => shows "Hacked"
    ```

    ### Patches
    Upgrade to [2.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/2.1.1) or
    [1.3.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/1.3.2).

    ### Workarounds
    Stop supplying untrusted input to `#manipulate!`'s mutation option.
  cvss_v3: 7.4
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 1.3.2"
  - ">= 2.1.1"
