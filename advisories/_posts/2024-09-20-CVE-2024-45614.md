  title: Puma's header normalization allows for client to clobber proxy set headers
  date: 2024-09-20
  description: |
    ### Impact

    Clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as
    X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same
    header (X-Forwarded_For).

    Any users trusting headers set by their proxy may be affected.
    Attackers may be able to downgrade connections to HTTP (non-SSL)
    or redirect responses, which could cause confidentiality leaks
    if combined with a separate MITM attack.

    ### Patches
    v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the
    non-underscore version also exists.  Effectively, allowing the
    proxy defined headers to always win.

    ### Workarounds
    Nginx has a [underscores_in_headers](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#underscores_in_headers)
    configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level.

    Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers
    for security or availability should immediately cease doing so
    until upgraded to the fixed versions.
