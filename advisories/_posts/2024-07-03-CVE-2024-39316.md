  title: Rack ReDoS Vulnerability in HTTP Accept Headers Parsing
  date: 2024-07-03
  description: |
    ### Summary

    A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists
    in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing HTTP Accept headers.
    This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker sending specially
    crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, causing the
    server to spend excessive time processing the request and leading
    to a Denial of Service (DoS).

    ### Details

    The fix for https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-54rr-7fvw-6x8f
    was not applied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed
    for the Rack v3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1
    release series until v3.1.5.
