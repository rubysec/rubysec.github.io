  date: 2024-02-13
  description: |
    Cross site scripting (XSS) potentially exposing cookies / sessions / localStorage, fixed by sidekiq-unique-jobs v8.0.7.

    ### Details

    Specially crafted URL query parameters handled by any of the following endpoints of sidekiq-unique-jobs' "admin" web UI,
    allow a super-user attacker, or an unwitting, but authorized, victim, who has received a disguised / crafted link,
    to successfully execute malicious code, which could potentially steal cookies, session data,
    or local storage data from the app the sidekiq-unique-jobs web UI is mounted in.

    If your sidekiq-unique-jobs web UI is mounted at `/sidekiq`, the vulnerable paths and query parameters are:

    * `/sidekiq/changelogs`
      * `filter`
      * `count`
    * `/sidekiq/locks`
      * `filter`
      * `count`
    * `/sidekiq/expiring_locks`
      * `filter`

    ### Impact

    This is a vulnerability of critical severity, which impacts many thousands of sites, since sidekiq-unique-jobs is widely deployed across the industry, with multiple attack vectors.

    ### Patches

    The fix for the XSS vulnerability was released in sidekiq-unique-jobs v8.0.7.
