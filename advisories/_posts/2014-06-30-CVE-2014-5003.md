  title: ciborg Gem for Ruby default.rb /tmp/perlbrew-installer Local Symlink File
    Overwrite
  date: 2014-06-30
  description: |
    ciborg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as default.rb creates temporary files
    insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack against
    the /tmp/perlbrew-installer file to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite
    an arbitrary file.
