  title: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic
    XSS) in Pay
  date: 2023-04-20
  description: |
    Impact
      A payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site
      scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a
      javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates
      Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target
      certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a
      functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments)
      the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.
    Patches
      This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.
      Pay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.
