  title: FlavourSaver handlebars helper remote code execution.
  date: 2014-09-04
  description: |
    FlavourSaver contains a flaw in helper method dispatch where it uses
    Kernel::send to call helpers without checking that they are defined
    within the template context first.  This allows expressions such as
    {{system "ls"}} or {{eval "puts 1 + 1"}} to be executed.
