  title: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in errors
  date: 2019-03-05
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Since
    Gem::CommandManager#run calls alert_error without escaping, escape sequence
    injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause an error.)
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.6"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.3"
  - "~> 2.7.9"
