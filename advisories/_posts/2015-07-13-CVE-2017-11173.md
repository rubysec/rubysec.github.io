  title: rack-cors Gem Missing Anchor permits unauthorized CORS requests
  date: 2015-07-13
  description: |
    Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors before 0.4.1
    allows a malicious third-party site to perform CORS requests.
    If the configuration were intended to allow only the trusted
    example.com domain name and not the malicious example.net domain name,
    then example.com.example.net (as well as example.com-example.net) would
    be inadvertently allowed.
  cvss_v2: 6.8
  cvss_v3: 8.8
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.4.1"
