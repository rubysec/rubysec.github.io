  title: Smashing Cross-site Scripting vulnerability
  date: 2022-05-24
  description: |
    Smashing 1.3.4 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). A URL for
    a widget can be crafted and used to execute JavaScript on the victim's computer.
    The JavaScript code can then steal data available in the session/cookies depending
    on the user environment (e.g. if re-using internal URL's for deploying, or cookies
    that are very permissive) private information may be retrieved by the attacker.
  cvss_v3: 6.1
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.3.5"
