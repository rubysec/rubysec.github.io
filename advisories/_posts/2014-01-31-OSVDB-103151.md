  title: 'Paperclip: Access Restriction Bypass'
  date: 2014-01-31
  description: |
    Paperclip Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the application
    failing to properly validate the file extension, instead only validating the Content-Type
    header during file uploads. This may allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions
    on file types for uploaded files by spoofing the content-type.
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.0.0"
