  description: |
    "An Insecure Permissions vulnerability in SpawningKit in Phusion Passenger
    5.3.x before 5.3.2 causes information disclosure in the following situation: given
    a Passenger-spawned application process that reports that it listens on a certain
    Unix domain socket, if any of the parent directories of said socket are writable
    by a normal user that is not the application''s user, then that non-application
    user can swap that directory with something else, resulting in traffic being redirected
    to a non-application user''s process through an alternative Unix domain socket."
