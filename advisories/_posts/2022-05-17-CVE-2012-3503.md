  title: Katello uses hard coded credential
  date: 2022-05-17
  description: |
    The installation script in Katello 1.0 and earlier does not properly
    generate the `Application.config.secret_token` value, which causes
    each default installation to have the same secret token, and allows
    remote attackers to authenticate to the CloudForms System Engine
    web interface as an arbitrary user by creating a cookie using the
    default `secret_token`.
