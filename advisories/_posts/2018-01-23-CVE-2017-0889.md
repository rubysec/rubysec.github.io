    Paperclip ruby gem suffers from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
    in the Paperclip::UriAdapter and Paperclip::HttpUrlProxyAdapter class.
  date: 2018-01-23
  description: |
    Paperclip gem provides multiple ways a file can be uploaded to a web server.
    The vulnerability affects two of Paperclipâ€™s IO adapters that accept URLs as
    attachment data (UriAdapter and HttpUrlProxyAdapter). When these adapters are
    used, Paperclip acts as a proxy and downloads the file from the website URI
    that is passed in. The library does not perform any validation to protect
    against Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) exploits by default. This may allow
    a remote attacker to access information about internal network resources.
