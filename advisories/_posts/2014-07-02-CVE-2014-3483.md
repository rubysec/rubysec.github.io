  description: |
    SQL injection vulnerability in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/quoting.rb
    in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.0.7 and
    4.1.x before 4.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by
    leveraging improper range quoting. It was discovered that Active Record did not
    properly quote values of the range type attributes when using the PostgreSQL database
    adapter. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an SQL injection
    attack against applications using Active Record.
