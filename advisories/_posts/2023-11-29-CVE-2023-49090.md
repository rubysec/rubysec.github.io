  title: CarrierWave Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading
    to XSS
  date: 2023-11-29
  description: |
    ###Impact
    [CarrierWave::Uploader::ContentTypeAllowlist](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/lib/carrierwave/uploader/content_type_allowlist.rb)
    has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS.

    The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type
    permissions by performing a partial match.
    If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed
    a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the
    `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed.

    In addition, by setting the Content-Type configured by the attacker
    at the time of file delivery, it is possible to cause XSS on the
    user's browser when the uploaded file is opened.

    ### Patches
    Upgrade to [3.0.5](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/3.0.5)
    or [2.2.5](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/2.2.5).

    ### Workarounds
    When validating with `allowlisted_content_type?` in
    [CarrierWave::Uploader::ContentTypeAllowlist](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/lib/carrierwave/uploader/content_type_allowlist.rb),
    forward match(`\\A`) the Content-Type set in `content_type_allowlist`,
    preventing unintentional permission of `text/html;image/png` when
    you want to allow only `image/png` in `content_type_allowlist`.
