    ### Summary

    There is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion
    when `net-imap` reads server responses.  At any time while the client
    is connected, a malicious server can send can send a "literal" byte
    count, which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread.
    The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of
    bytes indicated by the server response.

    This should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP
    servers that are well-behaved.  It can affect insecure connections
    and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting
    to a user supplied hostname).

    ### Details

    The IMAP protocol allows "literal" strings to be sent in responses,
    prefixed with their size in curly braces (e.g. `{1234567890}`).
    When `Net::IMAP` receives a response containing a literal string,
    it calls `IO#read` with that size.  When called with a size,
    `IO#read` immediately allocates memory to buffer the entire string
    before processing continues.  The server does not need to send any
    more data.  There is no limit on the size of literals that will be
    accepted.

    ### Fix
    #### Upgrade
    Users should upgrade to `net-imap` 0.5.7 or later.  A configurable
    `max_response_size` limit has been added to `Net::IMAP`'s response
    reader.  The `max_response_size` limit has also been backported to
    `net-imap` 0.2.5, 0.3.9, and 0.4.20.

    To set a global value for `max_response_size`, users must upgrade
    to `net-imap` ~> 0.4.20, or > 0.5.7.

    #### Configuration

    To avoid backward compatibility issues for secure connections to
    trusted well-behaved servers, the default `max_response_size` for
    `net-imap` 0.5.7 is _very high_ (512MiB), and the default
    `max_response_size` for `net-imap` ~> 0.4.20, ~> 0.3.9, and 0.2.5
    is `nil` (unlimited).

    When connecting to untrusted servers or using insecure connections,
    a much lower `max_response_size` should be used.
    ```ruby
    # Set the global max_response_size (only ~> v0.4.20, > 0.5.7)
    Net::IMAP.config.max_response_size = 256 << 10 # 256 KiB

    # Set when creating the connection
    imap = Net::IMAP.new(hostname, ssl: true,
                         max_response_size: 16 << 10) # 16 KiB

    # Set after creating the connection
    imap.max_response_size = 256 << 20 # 256 KiB
    # flush currently waiting read, to ensure the new setting is loaded
    imap.noop
    ```

    _**Please Note:**_ `max_response_size` only limits the size _per
    response_.  It does not prevent a flood of individual responses
    and it does not limit how many unhandled responses may be stored
    on the responses hash.  Users are responsible for adding response
    handlers to prune excessive unhandled responses.

    #### Compatibility with lower `max_response_size`

    A lower `max_response_size` may cause a few commands which
    legitimately return very large responses to raise an exception
    and close the connection.  The `max_response_size` could be
    temporarily set to a higher value, but paginated or limited
    versions of commands should be used whenever possible.  For
    example, to fetch message bodies:

    ```ruby
    imap.max_response_size = 256 << 20 # 256 KiB
    imap.noop # flush currently waiting read

    # fetch a message in 252KiB chunks
    size = imap.uid_fetch(uid, "RFC822.SIZE").first.rfc822_size
    limit = 252 << 10
    message = ((0..size)limit).each_with_object("") {|offset, str|
      str << imap.uid_fetch(uid,
      "BODY.PEEK[]<#{offset}.#{limit}>").first.message(offset:)
    }

    imap.max_response_size = 16 << 20 # 16 KiB
    imap.noop # flush currently waiting read
    ```
