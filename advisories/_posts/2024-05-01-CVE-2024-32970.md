  title: Phlex vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via maliciously formed HTML
    attribute names and values
  date: 2024-05-01
  description: |
    There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
    can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data.

    The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were
    working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account
    just how recklessly permissive browser are when it comes to executing
    unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes.

    ### Impact

    If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to an
    user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript
    when clicked by another user.

    ```ruby
    a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
    ```

    If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG
    tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output,
    executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

    ```ruby
    h1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))
    ```

    ### Patches

    Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex)
    for all minor versions released in the last year.

    - [1.10.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.10.2)
    - [1.9.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.3)

    If you are on `main`, it has been patched since
    [`da8f943`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/da8f94342a84cff9d78c98bcc3b3604ee2e577d2)

    ### Workarounds

    Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
    that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline)
    would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

    ### References

    In addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly
    recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does
    not allow `unsafe-inline`. Hereâ€™s how you can configure a Content
    Security Policy header in Rails.
