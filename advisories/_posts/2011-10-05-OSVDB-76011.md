  title: Spree Search ProductScope Class search[send][] Parameter Arbitrary Command
    Execution
  date: 2011-10-05
  description: |
    The ProductScope class fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via the
    'search[send][]' parameter resulting in arbitrary command execution. With a
    specially crafted request, a remote attacker can potentially cause arbitrary
    command execution.
