  title: rswag vulnerable to arbitrary JSON and YAML file read via directory traversal
  date: 2023-07-15
  description: |
    rswag before 2.10.1 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary JSON and
    YAML files via directory traversal, because rswag-api can expose a file that is
    not the OpenAPI (or Swagger) specification file of a project.
