  title: Possible DoS Vulnerability with Range Header in Rack
  date: 2024-02-21
  description: |
    There is a possible DoS vulnerability relating to the Range request header in
    Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26141.

    Versions Affected: >= 1.3.0. Not affected: < 1.3.0 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

    # Impact

    Carefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an
    unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead
    to a denial of service issue.

    Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the
    `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications).

    # Releases

    The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

    # Workarounds

    There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
