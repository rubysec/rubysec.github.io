    ## Summary

    It is possible to redirect a user to another origin if the
    "proceed_to" value in the session store is set to a
    protocol-relative URL.

    ## Details

    The google_sign_in gem persists an optional URL for redirection
    after authentication. If this URL is set to a protocol-relative URL,
    it improperly passes the "same origin" check, and it's possible
    for the user to be redirected to another origin after authentication,
    possibly resulting in exposure of authentication information if
    this attack is chained with other attacks.

    Normally the value of this URL is only written and read by the
    library or the calling application. However, it may be possible to
    set this session value from a malicious site with a form submission.

    ## Impact

    Any Rails applications using the google_sign_in gem may be vulnerable,
    if this vector can be chained with another attack that is able to
    modify the OAuth2 request parameters.

    ## Workarounds

    No known workarounds.
