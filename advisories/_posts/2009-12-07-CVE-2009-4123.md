  title: jruby-openssl Gem for JRuby fails to do proper certificate validation
  date: 2009-12-07
  description: |
    A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found where
    failed verification silently did nothing, making affected applications
    vulnerable to attackers. Attackers could lead a client application to believe
    that a secure connection to a rogue SSL server is legitimate. Attackers could
    also penetrate client-validated SSL server applications with a dummy
    certificate.
