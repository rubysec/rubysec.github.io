  title: Multipart parser buffers large non‑file fields entirely in memory, enabling
    DoS (memory exhaustion)
  date: 2025-10-07
  description: |
    ## Summary

    `Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without
    a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single
    large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of
    megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially
    leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS).

    ## Details

    During multipart parsing, file parts are streamed to temporary files,
    but non-file parts are buffered into memory:

    ```ruby
    body = String.new  # non-file → in-RAM buffer
    @mime_parts[mime_index].body << content
    ```

    There is no size limit on these in-memory buffers. As a result, any
    large text field—while technically valid—will be loaded fully into
    process memory before being added to `params`.

    ## Impact

    Attackers can send large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory
    usage. Impact scales with request size and concurrency, potentially
    leading to worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead. All
    Rack applications processing multipart form submissions are affected.

    ## Mitigation

    * **Upgrade:** Use a patched version of Rack that enforces a
      reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g., 2 MiB).

    * **Workarounds:**
      * Restrict maximum request body size at the web-server or proxy
        layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).
      * Validate and reject unusually large form fields at the application level.
