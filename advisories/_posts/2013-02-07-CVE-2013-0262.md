  description: |
    rack/file.rb (Rack::File) in Rack 1.5.x before 1.5.2 and 1.4.x before
    1.4.5 allows attackers to access arbitrary files outside the intended root directory
    via a crafted PATH_INFO environment variable, probably a directory traversal vulnerability
    that is remotely exploitable, aka "symlink path traversals."
  cvss_v2: 4.3
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 1.4.5"
  - ">= 1.5.2"
