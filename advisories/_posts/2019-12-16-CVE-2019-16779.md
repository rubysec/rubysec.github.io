  title: Race condition when using persistent connections
  description: |
    There was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection
    which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket.
    Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the
    previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it
    would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.

    Users can workaround the problem by disabling persistent connections, though
    this may cause performance implications.
