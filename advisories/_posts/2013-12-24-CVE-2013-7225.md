  title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby allows remote attackers to inject or manipulate
    SQL queries
  date: 2013-12-24
  description: |
    Fat Free CRM contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection
    attack. The issue is due to the app/controllers/home_controller.rb script
    not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'state' parameter or
    input passed via comments and emails. This may allow a remote attacker to
    inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for
    the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
