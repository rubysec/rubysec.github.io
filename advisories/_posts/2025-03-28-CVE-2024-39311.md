    ### Summary

    A publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site
    scripting attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality.

    ### Details

    A publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site
    scripting attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality.
    The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator
    to click a malicious link.

    We can create a redirect to a `javascript:alert()` URL. Whilst the
    redirect itself doesn't work, on the administrative panel, an a tag
    is created with the payload as the URI. Upon clicking this link,
    the XSS is triggered.

    An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or
    other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator
    that this is a malicious link.

    ### Impact

    A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their
    privileges and become an administrator."
