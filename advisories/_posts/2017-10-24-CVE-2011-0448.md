  title: Potential SQL Injection with limit in rails/activerecord
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to
    the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier
    for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a
    non-numeric argument.
  cvss_v2: 7.5
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 3.0.0"
