    ### Impact

    resque-web in resque versions before 2.1.0 is vulnerable to reflected
    XSS through the current_queue parameter in the path of the queues endpoint.

    ### Patches

    v2.1.0

    ### Workarounds

    No known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to not click
    on 3rd party or untrusted links to the resque-web interface until
    you have patched your application.
