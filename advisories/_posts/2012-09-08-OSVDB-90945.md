  title: Loofah HTML and XSS injection vulnerability
  date: 2012-09-08
  description: |
    Loofah Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site
    scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the
    Loofah::HTML::Document\#text function passes properly sanitized
    user-supplied input to the Loofah::XssFoliate and
    Loofah::Helpers\#strip_tags functions which convert input back to
    text. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted
    request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
    within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
