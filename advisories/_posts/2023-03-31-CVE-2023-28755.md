  title: Ruby URI component ReDoS issue
  date: 2023-03-31
  description: |
    A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component through 0.12.0 in
    Ruby through 3.2.1. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have
    specific characters. It causes an increase in execution time for parsing
    strings to URI objects. The fixed versions are 0.12.1, 0.11.1,
    0.10.2 and 0.10.0.1.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 0.10.0.1"
  - "~> 0.10.2"
  - "~> 0.11.1"
  - ">= 0.12.1"
