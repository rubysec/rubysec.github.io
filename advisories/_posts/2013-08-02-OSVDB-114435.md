  title: CSRF token fixation attacks in Devise
  date: 2013-08-02
  description: |
    Devise contains a flaw that allows a remote, user-assisted attacker to
    conduct a CSRF token fixation attack. This issue is triggered as previous
    CSRF tokens are not properly invalidated when a new token is created.
    If an attacker has knowledge of said token, a specially crafted request can
    be made to it, allowing the attacker to conduct CSRF attacks.
