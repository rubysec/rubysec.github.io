    ## Summary

    Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer `< 1.4.4` use an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.

    ## Mitigation

    Upgrade to rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.4.4`.
  cvss_v3: 7.5
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.4.4"
