  title: Dragonfly Gem for Ruby Image Uploading & Processing Remote Command Execution
  date: 2010-04-27
  description: |
    Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in Uploading & Processing
    that is due to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to
    imagemagicks convert. This may allow a remote attacker to gain
    read/write access to the filesystem and execute arbitrary commands.

    This gem has been renamed. Please use "dragonfly" from now on.
