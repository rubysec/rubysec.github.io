    3.0.0
  date: 2017-10-24
  description: |
    Ruby on Rails 2.3.9 and 3.0.0 does not properly handle nested
    attributes, which allows remote attackers to modify arbitrary
    records by changing the names of parameters for form inputs.

    Patches are available for 2.3 and 3.0 series.
  cvss_v2: 6.4
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.3.9"
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.3.9"
