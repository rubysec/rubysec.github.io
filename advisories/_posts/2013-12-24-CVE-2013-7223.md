  title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby contains multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    vulnerabilities
  date: 2013-12-24
  description: |
    Fat Free CRM contains a flaw as the application is missing the protect_from_forgery
    statement, therefore HTTP requests to app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    do not require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
    performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following a specially
    crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery
    (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to perform unspecified actions.
