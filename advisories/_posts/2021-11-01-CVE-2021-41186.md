  title: ReDoS vulnerability in parser_apache2
  date: 2021-11-01
  description: |
    ### Impact
    parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.

    ### Patches
    v1.14.2

    ### Workarounds
    Either of the following:

    * Don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs which cannot guarantee generated by Apache.
    * Put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin  directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).
  cvss_v3: 5.9
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 0.14.14"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.14.2"
