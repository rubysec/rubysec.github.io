  description: |
    actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails
    before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not
    properly consider differences in parameter handling between the
    Active Record component and the Rack interface, which allows remote
    attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform
    NULL checks via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain
    "[nil]" values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2694.
