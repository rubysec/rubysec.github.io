    ### Summary

    Nokogiri v1.13.9 upgrades the packaged version of its dependency libxml2 to
    [v2.10.3](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.3) from
    v2.9.14.

    libxml2 v2.10.3 addresses the following known vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2022-2309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309)
    - [CVE-2022-40304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304)
    - [CVE-2022-40303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303)

    Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of
    Nokogiri `< 1.13.9`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If
    you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries
    instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your
    distro's `libxml2` release announcements.


    ### Mitigation

    Upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.9`.

    Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated
    mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2
    `>= 2.10.3` which will also address these same issues.


    ### Impact

    #### libxml2 [CVE-2022-2309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309)

    - **CVSS3 score**: Under evaluation
    - **Type**: Denial of service
    - **Description**: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used
    together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not
    affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a
    vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by
    the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code
    shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually
    be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML
    converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and
    there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is
    received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be
    triggered.

    Nokogiri maintainers investigated at #2620 and determined this CVE does not
    affect Nokogiri users.


    #### libxml2 [CVE-2022-40304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304)

    - **CVSS3 score**: Unspecified upstream
    - **Type**: Data corruption, denial of service
    - **Description**: When an entity reference cycle is detected, the entity
    content is cleared by setting its first byte to zero. But the entity content
    might be allocated from a dict. In this case, the dict entry becomes corrupted
    leading to all kinds of logic errors, including memory errors like
    double-frees.

    #### libxml2 [CVE-2022-40303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303)

    - **CVSS3 score**: Unspecified upstream
    - **Type**: Integer overflow
    - **Description**: Integer overflows with XML_PARSE_HUGE
