  title: Improper handling of double quotes in file name in Diffy in Windows environment
  date: 2022-06-24
  description: |
    The function that calls the diff tool in versions of Diffy prior to 3.4.1
    does not properly handle double quotes in a filename when run in a Windows environment.
    This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted string.
