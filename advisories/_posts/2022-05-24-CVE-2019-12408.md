  title: Missing Initialization of Resource in Apache Arrow
  date: 2022-05-24
  description: |
    It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R,
    Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 had a uninitialized
    memory bug when building arrays with null values in some cases. This can lead to
    uninitialized memory being unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted
    over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file
    formats.
