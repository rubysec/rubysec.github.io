  title: Incorrect value comparison in Ruby openssl
  date: 2018-10-17
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby when two OpenSSL::X509::Name
    objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may
    return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or
    the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the
    same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be
    leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate
    and then used in signing or encryption operations.
