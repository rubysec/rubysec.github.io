  description: |
    kaminari versions prior to 0.16.2 are vulnerable to an Insecure File

    insecure file permissions.

    # Impact

    An attacker with local access could write arbitrary code to the affected files
    resulting in arbitrary code execution.

    Manually set the permissions of the affected files to `644`.
