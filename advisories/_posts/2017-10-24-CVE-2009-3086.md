  description: |
    A certain algorithm in Ruby on Rails 2.1.0 through 2.2.2, and 2.3.x
    before 2.3.4, leaks information about the complexity of message-digest
    signature verification in the cookie store, which might allow remote
    attackers to forge a digest via multiple attempts.
  cvss_v2: 5.0
  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.1.0"
  patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.2.3"
