  title: Command injection in cocoapods-downloader
  date: 2022-04-02
  description: |
    The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before
    1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling
    the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and
    branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional
    flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.
  cvss_v3: 8.1
  unaffected_versions:
  - ">= 1.6.0, < 1.6.2"
  patched_versions:
  - "= 1.6.0"
  - ">= 1.6.3"
