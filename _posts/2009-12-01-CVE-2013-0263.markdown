### DESCRIPTION

Rack contains a flaw that is due to an error in the Rack::Session::Cookie
function. Users of the Marshal session cookie encoding (the default), are
subject to a timing attack that may lead an attacker to execute arbitrary
code. This attack is more practical against 'cloud' users as intra-cloud
latencies are sufficiently low to make the attack viable.
