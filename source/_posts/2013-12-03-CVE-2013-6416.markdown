### CVE ID

* [CVE-2013-6416](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/5ZI1-H5OoIM)




### GEM NAME

* actionpack

### FRAMEWORK

* rails


### PATCHED VERSIONS


* `>= 4.0.2`


### DESCRIPTION

There is a vulnerability in the simple_format helper in Ruby on Rails.
The simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text 
which is intended to be safe for display. A change made to the 
implementation of this helper means that any user provided HTML 
attributes will not be escaped correctly. As a result of this error, 
applications which pass user-controlled data to be included as html 
attributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack.
