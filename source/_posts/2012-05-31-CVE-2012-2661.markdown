### DESCRIPTION

Ruby on Rails (RoR) contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out
an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the ActiveRecord class not
properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'where' method. This may
allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in an application
built on RoR, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
