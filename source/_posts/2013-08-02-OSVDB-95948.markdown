### OVSBD ID

* [OSVDB-95948](http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/95948)


### GEM NAME

* rgpg


### PATCHED VERSIONS


* `>= 0.2.3`


### DESCRIPTION

rgpg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the GpgHelper module (lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb).
The issue is due to the program failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input before being used in the system() function for execution.
This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
